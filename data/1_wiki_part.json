The name ''Austroasiatic'' comes from the [[Latin]] words for \"South\" and \"Asia\", hence \"South Asia\". Of these languages, only [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], [[Khmer language|Khmer]], and [[Mon language|Mon]] have a long-established [[recorded history]], and only Vietnamese and Khmer have official status as modern [[national language]]s (in [[Vietnam]] and [[Cambodia]], respectively). On the subnational level, [[Khasi language|Khasi]] has official status in [[Meghalaya]] while [[Santhali language|Santhali]], [[Ho language|Ho]] and [[Mundari language|Mundari]] are [[official language]]s of [[Jharkhand]]. In [[Myanmar]], the [[Wa language]] is the de facto official language of [[Wa State]]. The rest of the languages are spoken by minority groups and have no official status.\n\n''[[Ethnologue]]'' identifies 168 Austroasiatic languages. These form thirteen established families (plus perhaps [[Shompen language|Shompen]], which is poorly attested, as a fourteenth), which have traditionally been grouped into two, as Mon\u2013Khmer and [[Munda languages|Munda]]. However, one recent classification posits three groups (Munda, Nuclear Mon-Khmer and [[Khasi\u2013Khmuic languages|Khasi\u2013Khmuic]])<ref>Diffloth 2005</ref> while another has abandoned Mon\u2013Khmer as a taxon altogether, making it synonymous with the larger family.<ref>Sidwell 2009</ref>\n\nAustroasiatic languages have a disjunct distribution across India, Bangladesh, Nepal and Southeast Asia, separated by regions where other languages are spoken. They appear to be the [[autochthonous language]]s of Southeast Asia, with the neighboring [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tai\u2013Kadai languages|Tai\u2013Kadai]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]], [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]], and [[Sino-Tibetan languages]] being the result of later migrations.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\" />\n\n== Typology ==\n{{Expand section|date=November 2010}}\n\nRegarding word structure, Austroasiatic languages are well known for having an iambic [[sesquisyllable|\"sesquisyllabic\"]] pattern, with basic nouns and verbs consisting of an initial, unstressed, reduced [[minor syllable]] followed by a stressed, full syllable.<ref>\nAlves 2014:524</ref> This reduction of presyllables has led to a variety among modern languages of phonological shapes of the same original Proto-Austroasiatic prefixes, such as the causative prefix, ranging from CVC syllables to consonant clusters to single consonants.<ref>Alves 2014:526</ref> As for word formation, most Austroasiatic languages have a variety of derivational prefixes, many have [[infix]]es, but suffixes are almost completely non-existent in most branches except Munda, and a few specialized exceptions in other Austroasiatic branches.<ref>Alves 2014, 2015</ref> The Austroasiatic languages are further characterized as having unusually large vowel inventories and employing some sort of [[Register (phonology)|register]] contrast, either between [[modal voice|modal]] (normal) voice and [[breathy voice|breathy]] (lax) voice or between modal voice and [[creaky voice]].<ref>DIPFLOTH, Gerard. [http://www.sealang.net/archives/mks/pdf/15:139-154.pdf \"Proto-Austroasiatic creaky voice.\"] (1989).</ref> Languages in the Pearic branch and some in the Vietic branch can have a three- or even four-way voicing contrast. However, some Austroasiatic languages have lost the register contrast by evolving more diphthongs or in a few cases, such as Vietnamese, [[tonogenesis]]. Vietnamese has been so heavily influenced by Chinese that its original Austroasiatic phonological quality is obscured and now resembles that of South Chinese languages, whereas Khmer, which had more influence from Sanskrit, has retained a more typically Austroasiatic structure.\n\n==Proto-language==\n{{Main article|Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer language}}\n\nMuch work has been done on the reconstruction of [[Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer]] in [[Harry L. Shorto]]'s ''Mon\u2013Khmer Comparative Dictionary''. Little work has been done on the [[Munda languages]], which are not well documented. With their demotion from a primary branch, Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer becomes synonymous with Proto-Austroasiatic.\n\n[[Paul Sidwell]] (2005) reconstructs the consonant inventory of Proto-Mon\u2013Khmer as follows:\n\n{| class=\"IPA wikitable\"\n|-\n| *p || *t || *c || *k || *\u0294\n|-\n| *b || *d || *\u025f || *\u0261 ||\n|-\n| *\u0253 || *\u0257 || *\u0284 || ||\n|-\n| *m || *n || *\u0272 || *\u014b ||\n|-\n| *w || *l, *r || *j || ||\n|-\n| || *s || || || *h\n|}\n\nThis is identical to earlier reconstructions except for {{IPA|*\u0284}}.  {{IPA|*\u0284}} is better preserved in the [[Katuic languages]], which Sidwell has specialized in. Sidwell (2011) suggests that the likely homeland of Austroasiatic is the middle [[Mekong]], in the area of the Bahnaric and Katuic languages (approximately where modern Laos, Thailand, and Cambodia come together), and that the family is not as old as frequently assumed, dating to perhaps 2000 BCE.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\" />\n\n==Internal classification==\nLinguists traditionally recognize two primary divisions of Austroasiatic: the Mon\u2013Khmer languages of Southeast Asia, [[North-East India|Northeast India]] and the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the Munda languages of [[East India|East]] and Central India and parts of Bangladesh. However, no evidence for this classification has ever been published.\n\nEach of the families that is written in boldface type below is accepted as a valid clade.{{clarify|date=February 2016}} By contrast, the relationships ''between'' these families within Austroasiatic is debated. In addition to the traditional classification, two recent proposals are given, neither of which accept traditional \"Mon\u2013Khmer\" as a valid unit. However, little of the data used for competing classifications has ever been published, and therefore cannot be evaluated by peer review.\n\nIn addition, there are suggestions that additional branches of Austroasiatic might be preserved in substrata of [[Acehnese language|Acehnese]] in Sumatra (Diffloth), the [[Chamic languages]] of Vietnam, and the [[Land Dayak languages]] of Borneo (Adelaar 1995).<ref>Roger Blench, ''2009.

He therefore takes the conservative view that the thirteen branches of Austroasiatic should be treated as equidistant on current evidence. Sidwell & [[Roger Blench|Blench]] (2011) discuss this proposal in more detail, and note that there is good evidence for a Khasi\u2013Palaungic node, which could also possibly be closely related to Khmuic.<ref name=\"SidwellBlench2011\">Sidwell, Paul, and Roger Blench. 2011. \"The Austroasiatic Urheimat: the Southeastern Riverine Hypothesis.\" Enfield, N.J.

Sidwell & Blench (2011) suggest [[Shompen language|Shompen]] as an additional branch, and believe that a Vieto-Katuic connection is worth investigating. In general, however, the family is thought to have diversified too quickly for a deeply nested structure to have developed, since Proto-Austroasiatic speakers are believed by Sidwell to have radiated out from the central [[Mekong]] River valley relatively quickly.\n\n{{clade\n| label1=Austroasiatic&nbsp;<br />=&nbsp;Mon\u2013Khmer&nbsp;\n| 1={{clade\n| 1=[[Munda languages|Munda]]\n| label2=&nbsp;Khasi\u2013Palaungic&nbsp;\n| 2={{clade\n| 1=[[Khasic languages|Khasian]]\n| 2=[[Palaungic languages|Palaungic]]\n}}\n| 3=[[Khmuic languages|Khmuic]]\n| 4=[[Pakanic languages|Pakanic]]\n| 6=[[Vietic languages|Vietic]]\n| 7=[[Katuic languages|Katuic]]\n| 8=[[Bahnaric languages|Bahnaric]]\n| 9=[[Khmer language|Khmer]]\n| 10=[[Pearic languages|Pearic]]\n| 11=[[Monic languages|Monic]]\n| 12=[[Aslian languages|Aslian]]\n| 13=[[Nicobarese languages|Nicobarese]]\n| 14=?[[Shompen language|Shompen]]\n}}\n}}\n\n==Writing systems==\nOther than Latin-based alphabets, many Austroasiatic languages are written with the ancient [[Khmer alphabet]], [[Thai alphabet]] and [[Lao alphabet]].

However, it did not come into general use until [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1950) formally proposed its adoption. In doing so, Greenberg sought to emphasize the fact that Afroasiatic spanned the continents of both Africa and Asia.<ref name=\"Lipi\u0144ski\" />\n\nIndividual scholars have also called the family \"Erythraean\" (Tucker 1966) and \"Lisramic\" (Hodge 1972). In lieu of \"Hamito-Semitic\", the Russian linguist [[Igor Diakonoff]] later suggested the term \"Afrasian\", meaning \"half African, half Asiatic\", in reference to the geographic distribution of the family's constituent languages.<ref name=NEB>{{cite book|title=The New Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Volume 8; Volume 22|year=1998|publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|isbn=0-85229-633-9|pages=722|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=6-lMAQAAIAAJ}}</ref>\n\nThe term \"Hamito-Semitic\" remains in use in the academic traditions of some European countries.\n\n==Distribution and branches==\n[[File:Interrelations between branches of Afro-Asiatic.svg|thumb|300px|Interrelations between branches of Afroasiatic (Lipi\u0144ski 2001).]]\n[[File:afroasiatic.svg|thumb|right|300px|Some linguists' proposals for grouping within Afroasiatic.]]\nThe Afroasiatic language family is usually considered to include the following branches:\n* [[Berber languages|Berber]]\n* [[Chadic languages|Chadic]]\n* [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]]\n* [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]]\n* [[Omotic languages|Omotic]]\n* [[Semitic languages|Semitic]]\n\nAlthough there is general agreement on these six families, there are some points of disagreement among [[linguistics|linguists]] who study Afroasiatic. In particular:\n* The [[Omotic]] language branch is the most controversial member of Afroasiatic, because the grammatical formatives that most linguists have given greatest weight in classifying languages in the family \"are either absent or distinctly wobbly\" (Hayward 1995). Greenberg (1963) and others considered it a subgroup of Cushitic, whereas others have raised doubts about it being part of Afroasiatic at all (e.g. Theil 2006).<ref name=\"Sands2009\">Sands, Bonny (2009). \"Africa\u2019s Linguistic Diversity\". Language and Linguistics Compass 3/2 (2009): 559\u2013580, 10.1111/j.1749-818x.2008.00124.x</ref>\n* The Afroasiatic identity of [[Ongota language|Ongota]] is also broadly questioned, as is its position within Afroasiatic among those who accept it, due to the \"mixed\" appearance of the language and a paucity of research and data. [[Harold C. Fleming|Harold Fleming]] (2006) proposes that Ongota constitutes a separate branch of Afroasiatic.<ref>[http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/pcgi/a.cgi?ausgabe=index&T=1235007315045{haupt_harrassowitz=http://www.harrassowitz-verlag.de/title_3277.ahtml?T=1235007315045} Harrassowitz Verlag - The Harrassowitz Publishing House<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Bonny Sands (2009) believes the most convincing proposal is by Sav\u00e0 and Tosco (2003), namely that Ongota is an East Cushitic language with a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] [[substratum]]. In other words, it would appear that the Ongota people once spoke a Nilo-Saharan language but then shifted to speaking a Cushitic language but retained some characteristics of their earlier Nilo-Saharan language.<ref name=\"Sands2009\"/>\n* [[Beja language|Beja]] is sometimes listed as a separate branch of Afroasiatic but is more often included in the Cushitic branch, which has a high degree of internal diversity.\n* Whether the various branches of Cushitic actually form a language family is sometimes questioned, but not their inclusion in Afroasiatic itself.\n* There is no consensus on the interrelationships of the five non-Omotic branches of Afroasiatic (see [[# Subgrouping|\u00a7 Subgrouping]] below). This situation is not unusual, even among long-established language families: there are also many disagreements concerning the internal classification of the [[Indo-European languages]], for instance.\n* [[Meroitic language|Meroitic]] has been proposed as an unclassified Afroasiatic language, because it shares the [[phonotactics]] characteristic of the family, but there is not enough evidence to secure a classification.\n\n==Classification history==<!-- This section is linked from [[Berber people]] -->\nIn the 9th century, the Hebrew grammarian [[Judah ibn Kuraish|Judah ibn Quraysh]] of [[Tiaret]] in [[Algeria]] was the first to link two branches of Afroasiatic together; he perceived a relationship between Berber and Semitic. He knew of Semitic through his study of Arabic, Hebrew, and [[Aramaic]].\n\nIn the course of the 19th century, Europeans also began suggesting such relationships. In 1844, [[Theodor Benfey]] suggested a language family consisting of Semitic, Berber, and Cushitic (calling the latter \"Ethiopic\"). In the same year, T.N. Newman suggested a relationship between Semitic and Hausa, but this would long remain a topic of dispute and uncertainty.\n\n[[Friedrich M\u00fcller (linguist)|Friedrich M\u00fcller]] named the traditional Hamito-Semitic family in 1876 in his ''Grundriss der Sprachwissenschaft'' (\"Outline of Linguistics\"), and defined it as consisting of a Semitic group plus a \"Hamitic\" group containing Egyptian, Berber, and Cushitic; he excluded the Chadic group. It was the [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] (1810&ndash;1884) who restricted Hamitic to the non-Semitic languages in Africa, which are characterized by a grammatical [[Grammatical gender|gender system]]. This \"Hamitic language group\" was proposed to unite various, mainly North-African, languages, including the Ancient [[Egyptian language]], the [[Berber languages]], the [[Cushitic languages]], the [[Beja language]], and the [[Chadic languages]]. Unlike M\u00fcller, Lepsius considered that [[Hausa language|Hausa]] and [[Nama language|Nama]] were part of the Hamitic group. These classifications relied in part on non-linguistic anthropological and racial arguments. Both authors used the skin-color, mode of subsistence, and other characteristics of native speakers as part of their arguments that particular languages should be grouped together.<ref name = \"mer\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages: Classification'', Stanford University Press, 1991, pp. 80\u20131</ref>\n[[File:Africa ethnic groups 1996.jpg|thumb|Distribution of the Afroasiatic/Hamito-Semitic languages in Africa ([[Library of Congress]]).]]\nIn 1912, [[Carl Meinhof]] published ''Die Sprachen der Hamiten'' (\"The Languages of the Hamites\"), in which he expanded Lepsius's model, adding the [[Fula language|Fula]], [[Maasai language|Maasai]], [[Bari language|Bari]], [[Nandi languages|Nandi]], [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]] and [[Hadza language|Hadza]] languages to the Hamitic group. Meinhof's model was widely supported into the 1940s.<ref name = \"mer\"/> Meinhof's system of classification of the Hamitic languages was based on a belief that \"speakers of Hamitic became largely coterminous with cattle herding peoples with essentially Caucasian origins, intrinsically different from and superior to the 'Negroes of Africa'.\"<ref>Kevin Shillington, ''Encyclopedia of African History'', CRC Press, 2005, p.797</ref> But, in the case of the so-called [[Nilo-Hamitic languages]] (a concept he introduced), it was based on the typological feature of gender and a \"fallacious theory of [[mixed language|language mixture]].\" Meinhof did this although earlier work by scholars such as Lepsius and Johnston had substantiated that the languages which he would later dub \"Nilo-Hamitic\" were in fact Nilotic languages, with numerous similarities in vocabulary to other Nilotic languages.<ref name=\"Ruhlen109\">Merritt Ruhlen, ''A Guide to the World's Languages'', (Stanford University Press: 1991), p.109</ref>\n\n[[Leo Reinisch]] (1909) had already proposed linking Cushitic and Chadic, while urging their more distant affinity with Egyptian and Semitic. However, his suggestion found little acceptance. [[Marcel Cohen]] (1924) rejected the idea of a distinct \"Hamitic\" subgroup, and included [[Hausa language|Hausa]] (a Chadic language) in his comparative Hamito-Semitic vocabulary. Finally, [[Joseph Greenberg]]'s 1950 work led to the widespread rejection of \"Hamitic\" as a language category by linguists. Greenberg refuted Meinhof's linguistic theories, and rejected the use of racial and social evidence. In dismissing the notion of a separate \"Nilo-Hamitic\" language category in particular, Greenberg was \"returning to a view widely held a half century earlier.\" He consequently rejoined Meinhof's so-called Nilo-Hamitic languages with their appropriate Nilotic siblings.<ref name=\"Ruhlen\"/> He also added (and sub-classified) the Chadic languages, and proposed the new name Afroasiatic for the family. Almost all scholars have accepted this classification as the new and continued consensus.\n\nGreenberg's model was fully developed in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963), in which he reassigned most of Meinhof's additions to Hamitic to other language families, notably [[Nilo-Saharan]]. Following [[Isaac Schapera]] and rejecting Meinhof, he classified the [[Hottentot language]] as a member of the Central [[Khoisan languages]]. To Khoisan he also added the Tanzanian [[Hadza language|Hadza]] and [[Sandawe language|Sandawe]], though this view remains controversial since some scholars consider these languages to be [[Language isolate|linguistic isolates]].<ref>Sands, Bonny E.

Each of these branches is instead now regarded as an independent subgroup of the larger Afroasiatic family.<ref name=\"Welmers\">{{cite book|last1=Everett Welmers|first1=William|title=African Language Structures|date=1974|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0520022106|page=16|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=hCxpK-CkdgYC&pg=PA16#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\nIn 1969, [[Harold C.

However, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1979), Harold Fleming (1981), and Joseph Greenberg (1981) all agree that the Omotic branch split from the rest first.\n\nOtherwise:\n* [[Paul Newman (linguist)|Paul Newman]] (1980) groups Berber with Chadic and Egyptian with Semitic, while questioning the inclusion of Omotic in Afroasiatic. Rolf Theil (2006) concurs with the exclusion of Omotic, but does not otherwise address the structure of the family.<ref>[http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/hf/iln/LING2110/v07/THEIL%20Is%20Omotic%20Afroasiatic.pdf Is Omotic Afroasiatic? (In Norwegian)]</ref>\n* Harold Fleming (1981) divides non-Omotic Afroasiatic, or \"Erythraean\", into three groups, Cushitic, Semitic, and Chadic-Berber-Egyptian. He later added Semitic and Beja to Chadic-Berber-Egyptian and tentatively proposed [[Ongota language|Ongota]] as a new third branch of Erythraean. He thus divided Afroasiatic into two major branches, Omotic and Erythraean, with Erythraean consisting of three sub-branches, Cushitic, Chadic-Berber-Egyptian-Semitic-Beja, and Ongota.\n* Like Harold Fleming, [[Christopher Ehret]] (1995: 490) divides Afroasiatic into two branches, Omotic and Erythrean. He divides Omotic into two branches, North Omotic and South Omotic. He divides Erythrean into Cushitic, comprising Beja, Agaw, and East-South Cushitic, and North Erythrean, comprising Chadic and \"Boreafrasian.\" According to his classification, Boreafrasian consists of Egyptian, Berber, and Semitic.\n* [[Vladimir Orel]] and Olga Stolbova (1995) group Berber with Semitic and Chadic with Egyptian. They split up Cushitic into five or more independent branches of Afroasiatic, viewing Cushitic as a [[Sprachbund]] rather than a [[language family]].\n* [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1996) subdivides Afroasiatic in two, grouping Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as East-West Afrasian (ESA), and Chadic with Egyptian as North-South Afrasian (NSA). He excludes Omotic from Afroasiatic.\n* [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] (1997) groups Berber, Cushitic, and Semitic together as \"Macro-Cushitic\". He regards Chadic and Omotic as the branches of Afroasiatic most remote from the others.\n* Alexander Militarev (2000), on the basis of [[lexicostatistics]], groups Berber with Chadic and both more distantly with Semitic, as against Cushitic and Omotic. He places Ongota in South Omotic.\n\n==Position among the world's languages==\nAfroasiatic is one of the four major [[Languages of Africa|language families]] spoken in Africa identified by Joseph Greenberg in his book ''[[The Languages of Africa]]'' (1963). It is one of the few whose speech area is transcontinental, with languages from Afroasiatic's Semitic branch also spoken in the Middle East and Europe.\n\nThere are no generally accepted relations between Afroasiatic and any other language family. However, several proposals grouping Afroasiatic with one or more other language families have been made. The best-known of these are the following:\n* [[Hermann M\u00f6ller]] (1906) argued for a relation between [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and the [[Indo-European languages]]. This proposal was accepted by a few linguists (e.g. [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] and [[Louis Hjelmslev]]). (For a fuller account, see [[Indo-Semitic languages]].) However, the theory has little currency today, although most linguists do not deny the existence of grammatical similarities between both families (such as grammatical gender, noun-adjective agreement, three-way number distinction, and vowel alternation as a means of derivation).\n* Apparently influenced by M\u00f6ller (a colleague of his at the [[University of Copenhagen]]), [[Holger Pedersen (linguist)|Holger Pedersen]] included Hamito-Semitic (the term replaced by Afroasiatic) in his proposed Nostratic macro-family (cf. Pedersen 1931:336\u2013338), also included the Indo-European, [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], [[Yukaghir languages]], and [[Dravidian Languages]]. This inclusion was retained by subsequent Nostraticists, starting with [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky]].\n* [[Joseph Greenberg]] (2000\u20132002) did not reject a relationship of Afroasiatic to these other languages, but he considered it more distantly related to them than they were to each other, grouping instead these other languages in a separate macro-family, which he called [[Eurasiatic languages|Eurasiatic]], and to which he added [[Chukotko-Kamchatkan languages|Chukotian]], [[Nivkh language|Gilyak]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japonic languages|Japanese-Ryukyuan]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Eskimo\u2013Aleut]], and [[Ainu languages|Ainu]].\n* Most recently, [[Sergei Anatolyevich Starostin|Sergei Starostin]]'s school has accepted Eurasiatic as a subgroup of Nostratic, with Afroasiatic, Dravidian and Kartvelian in Nostratic outside of Eurasiatic. The even larger Borean super-family contains Nostratic as well as [[Den\u00e9\u2013Caucasian languages|Den\u00e9-Caucasian]] and [[Austric languages|Austric]].\n\n==Date of Afroasiatic==\n[[File:Assyriansample.ogg|thumb|right|180px|Speech sample in the Semitic [[Assyrian Neo-Aramaic|Neo-Aramaic]] language, a descendant of [[Old Aramaic]].]]\nThe earliest written evidence of an Afroasiatic language is an [[Egyptian language|Ancient Egyptian]] inscription dated to c. 3400 BC (5,400 years ago).<ref>[http://www.archaeology.org/9903/newsbriefs/egypt.html Earliest Egyptian Glyphs<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Symbols on [[Gerzeh culture|Gerzean]] (Naqada II) pottery resembling [[Egyptian hieroglyphs#History and evolution|Egyptian hieroglyphs]] date back to c. 4000 BC, suggesting an earlier possible dating. This gives us a minimum date for the age of Afroasiatic. However, Ancient Egyptian is highly divergent from [[Proto-Afroasiatic language|Proto-Afroasiatic]] (Trombetti 1905: 1\u20132), and considerable time must have elapsed in between them. Estimates of the date at which the Proto-Afroasiatic language was spoken vary widely. They fall within a range between approximately 7,500 BC (9,500 years ago), and approximately 16,000 BC (18,000 years ago). According to [[Igor M. Diakonoff]] (1988: 33n), Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken [[circa|c.]] 10,000 BC. Christopher Ehret (2002: 35\u201336) asserts that Proto-Afroasiatic was spoken c. 11,000 BC at the latest, and possibly as early as c. 16,000 BC. These dates are older than those associated with other [[proto-language]]s.\n\n==Afroasiatic Urheimat==\n{{main|Afroasiatic Urheimat}}\n[[File:Expansion of Afroasiatic.svg|thumb|upright|Map showing one of the proposed Afroasiatic Urheimat.]]\nThe term Afroasiatic Urheimat (''Urheimat'' meaning \"original homeland\" in German) refers to the hypothetical place where [[Proto-Afroasiatic language]] speakers lived in a single linguistic community, or complex of communities, before this original language dispersed geographically and divided into distinct languages. Afroasiatic languages are today primarily spoken in [[Western Asia|West Asia]], [[North Africa]], the [[Horn of Africa]], and parts of the [[Sahel]]. Their distribution seems to have been influenced by the [[Sahara pump theory|Sahara pump]] operating over the last 10,000 years.\n\nThere is no agreement when or where the original homeland of this language family existed.

The word ''Andosini'' or ''Andosins'' (\u1f08\u03bd\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2) may derive from the [[Basque language|Basque]] ''handia'' whose meaning is \"big\" or \"giant\".<ref name=\"Diccionari\">''Diccionari d'Hist\u00f2ria de Catalunya''; ed. 62; Barcelona; 1998; {{ISBN|84-297-3521-6}}; p. 42; entrada \"Andorra\"</ref> The Andorran [[toponymy]] shows evidence of [[Basque language]] in the area.

This peculiarity makes the President of France, in his capacity as [[Prince of Andorra]], an elected reigning monarch, although he is not elected by a popular vote of the Andorran people. The politics of Andorra take place in a framework of a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] [[representative democracy]], whereby the [[List of heads of government of Andorra|Head of Government]] is the [[head of government|chief executive]], and of a [[wiktionary:pluriform|pluriform]] multi-party system.\n\nThe current Head of Government is [[Antoni Mart\u00ed]] of the [[Democrats for Andorra]] (DA). [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. Legislative power is vested in both government and parliament.\n\nThe Parliament of Andorra is known as the General Council. The General Council consists of between 28 and 42 Councillors. The Councillors serve for four-year terms, and elections are held between the 30th and 40th days following the dissolution of the previous Council.\n\nHalf are elected in equal numbers by each of the seven administrative parishes, and the other half of the Councillors are elected in a single national constituency. Fifteen days after the election, the Councillors hold their inauguration. During this session, the Syndic General, who is the head of the General Council, and the Subsyndic General, his assistant, are elected. Eight days later, the Council convenes once more. During this session the Head of Government is chosen from among the Councillors.\n\n[[File:Casa de la Vall - 18.jpg|thumb|Casa de la Vall, Andorran Parliament]]\n\nCandidates can be proposed by a minimum of one-fifth of the Councillors. The Council then elects the candidate with the absolute majority of votes to be Head of Government. The Syndic General then notifies the Co-Princes, who in turn appoint the elected candidate as the Head of Government of Andorra. The General Council is also responsible for proposing and passing laws. Bills may be presented to the Council as Private Members' Bills by three of the local Parish Councils jointly or by at least one tenth of the citizens of Andorra.\n\nThe Council also approves the annual budget of the principality. The government must submit the proposed budget for parliamentary approval at least two months before the previous budget expires. If the budget is not approved by the first day of the next year, the previous budget is extended until a new one is approved. Once any bill is approved, the Syndic General is responsible for presenting it to the Co-Princes so that they may sign and enact it.\n\nIf the Head of Government is not satisfied with the Council, he may request that the Co-Princes dissolve the Council and order new elections. In turn, the Councillors have the power to remove the Head of Government from office. After a motion of censure is approved by at least one-fifth of the Councillors, the Council will vote and if it receives the absolute majority of votes, the Head of Government is removed.\n\n==Law and criminal justice==\nThe judiciary is composed of the Magistrates Court, the Criminal Law Court, the High Court of Andorra, and the Constitutional Court. The High Court of Justice is composed of five judges: one appointed by the Head of Government, one each by the Co-Princes, one by the Syndic General, and one by the Judges and Magistrates. It is presided over by the member appointed by the Syndic General and the judges hold office for six-year terms.\n\nThe Magistrates and Judges are appointed by the High Court, as is the President of the Criminal Law Court. The High Court also appoints members of the Office of the Attorney General. The Constitutional Court is responsible for interpreting the Constitution and reviewing all appeals of unconstitutionality against laws and treaties. It is composed of four judges, one appointed by each of the Co-Princes and two by the General Council. They serve eight-year terms. The Court is presided over by one of the Judges on a two-year rotation so that each judge at one point will preside over the Court.\n\n==Foreign relations, defence, and security==\n{{Main|Foreign relations of Andorra}}\n[[File:Bruxelles rue de la Montagne 10.jpg|thumb|The embassy of Andorra in [[Brussels]] ]]\nAndorra does not have its own armed forces,<ref name=\"cia\"/> although there is a small ceremonial army.

The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some contexts in mathematics and statistics because it helps distinguish it from other [[average|mean]]s, such as the [[geometric mean]] and the [[harmonic mean]].\n\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is used frequently in fields such as economics, [[sociology]], and history, and it is used in almost every academic field to some extent. For example, [[per capita income]] is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.\n\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report [[central tendency|central tendencies]], it is not a [[robust statistic]], meaning that it is greatly influenced by [[outlier]]s (values that are very much larger or smaller than most of the values). Notably, for [[skewed distribution]]s, such as the [[distribution of income]] for which a few people's incomes are substantially greater than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not accord with one's notion of \"middle\", and robust statistics, such as the [[median]], may be a better description of central tendency.\n\n==Definition==\nThe '''arithmetic mean''' (or '''mean''' or '''average''') is the most commonly used and readily understood measure of central tendency. In statistics, the term average refers to any of the measures of central tendency. The arithmetic mean is defined as being equal to the sum of the numerical values of each and every observation divided by the total number of observations. Symbolically, if we have a data set containing the values <math>a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n</math>, then the arithmetic mean <math>A</math> is defined by the formula:\n\n:<math>A=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n a_i=\\frac{a_1+a_2+\\cdots+a_n}{n}</math>\n\n(See [[summation]] for an explanation of the [[summation operator]]).\n\nFor example, let us consider the monthly salary of 10 employees of a firm: 2500, 2700, 2400, 2300, 2550, 2650, 2750, 2450, 2600, 2400. The arithmetic mean is\n\n: <math>\\frac{ 2500+ 2700+ 2400+ 2300+ 2550+ 2650+ 2750+ 2450+ 2600+ 2400}{10}=2530.</math>\n\nIf the data set is a [[statistical population]] (i.e., consists of every possible observation and not just a subset of them), then the mean of that population is called the '''population mean'''. If the data set is a [[sampling (statistics)|statistical sample]] (a subset of the population), we call the statistic resulting from this calculation a '''sample mean'''.\n\nThe arithmetic mean of a variable is often denoted by a bar, for example as in <math>\\bar{x}</math> (read <math>x</math> ''bar''), which is the mean of the <math>n</math> values <math>x_1,x_2,\\ldots,x_n</math>.<ref name=\"JM\">{{cite book| last = Medhi| first = Jyotiprasad| title = Statistical Methods: An Introductory Text| url = https://books.google.com/?id=bRUwgf_q5RsC| year = 1992| publisher = New Age International| isbn = 9788122404197| pages = 53\u201358 }}</ref>\n\n==Motivating properties==\n\nThe arithmetic mean has several properties that make it useful, especially as a measure of central tendency. These include:\n\n* If numbers <math>x_1,\\dotsc,x_n</math> have mean <math>\\bar{x}</math>, then <math>(x_1-\\bar{x}) + \\dotsb + (x_n-\\bar{x}) = 0</math>. Since <math>x_i-\\bar{x}</math> is the distance from a given number to the mean, one way to interpret this property is as saying that the numbers to the left of the mean are balanced by the numbers to the right of the mean. The mean is the only single number for which the [[errors and residuals in statistics|residuals]] (deviations from the estimate) sum to zero.\n* If it is required to use a single number as a \"typical\" value for a set of known numbers <math>x_1,\\dotsc,x_n</math>, then the arithmetic mean of the numbers does this best, in the sense of minimizing the sum of squared deviations from the typical value: the sum of <math>(x_i-\\bar{x})^2</math>. (It follows that the sample mean is also the best single predictor in the sense of having the lowest [[root mean squared error]].)<ref name=\"JM\"/> If the arithmetic mean of a population of numbers is desired, then the estimate of it that is [[unbiased estimate|unbiased]] is the arithmetic mean of a sample drawn from the population.\n\n==Contrast with median==\n\nThe arithmetic mean may be contrasted with the median. The median is defined such that no more than half the values are larger than, and no more than half are smaller than, the median. If elements in the sample data [[arithmetic progression|increase arithmetically]], when placed in some order, then the median and arithmetic average are equal. For example, consider the data sample <math>{1,2,3,4}</math>. The average is <math>2.5</math>, as is the median. However, when we consider a sample that cannot be arranged so as to increase arithmetically, such as <math>{1,2,4,8,16}</math>, the median and arithmetic average can differ significantly. In this case, the arithmetic average is 6.2 and the median is 4. In general, the average value can vary significantly from most values in the sample, and can be larger or smaller than most of them.\n\nThere are applications of this phenomenon in many fields. For example, since the 1980s, the median income in the United States has increased more slowly than the arithmetic average of income.<ref>Paul Krugman, [http://prospect.org/article/rich-right-and-facts-deconstructing-inequality-debate \"The Rich, the Right, and the Facts: Deconstructing the Income Distribution Debate\"], 'The American Prospect'</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n===Weighted average===\n{{main|Weighted average}}\nA weighted average, or weighted mean, is an average in which some data points count more strongly than others, in that they are given more weight in the calculation. For example, the arithmetic mean of <math>3</math> and <math>5</math> is <math>\\frac{(3+5)}{2} = 4</math>, or equivalently <math>\\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 3\\right) + \\left( \\frac{1}{2} \\cdot 5\\right) = 4</math>. In contrast, a ''weighted'' mean in which the first number receives, for example, twice as much weight as the second (perhaps because it is assumed to appear twice as often in the general population from which these numbers were sampled) would be calculated as <math>\\left( \\frac{2}{3} \\cdot 3\\right) + \\left(\\frac{1}{3} \\cdot 5\\right) = \\frac{11}{3}</math>. Here the weights, which necessarily sum to the value one, are <math>(2/3)</math> and <math>(1/3)</math>, the former being twice the latter. Note that the arithmetic mean (sometimes called the \"unweighted average\" or \"equally weighted average\") can be interpreted as a special case of a weighted average in which all the weights are equal to each other (equal to <math>\\frac{1}{2}</math> in the above example, and equal to <math>\\frac{1}{n}</math> in a situation with <math>n</math> numbers being averaged).\n\n===Continuous probability distributions===\n\n[[File:Comparison mean median mode.svg|thumb|300px|Comparison of mean, [[median]] and [[mode (statistics)|mode]] of two [[log-normal distribution]]s with different [[skewness]].]]\n\nWhen a population of numbers, and any sample of data from it, could take on any of a continuous range of numbers, instead of for example just integers, then the [[probability]] of a number falling into one range of possible values could differ from the probability of falling into a different range of possible values, even if the lengths of both ranges are the same. In such a case, the set of probabilities can be described using a [[continuous probability distribution]]. The analog of a weighted average in this context, in which there are an infinitude of possibilities for the precise value of the variable, is called the ''mean of the probability distribution''. The most widely encountered probability distribution is called the [[normal distribution]]; it has the property that all measures of its central tendency, including not just the mean but also the aforementioned median and the [[Mode (statistics)|mode]], are equal to each other. This property does not hold however, in the cases of a great many probability distributions, such as the [[lognormal distribution]] illustrated here.\n\n==Angles==\n{{Main|Mean of circular quantities}}\n\nParticular care must be taken when using cyclic data, such as phases or [[angle]]s. Na\u00efvely taking the arithmetic mean of 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 yields a result of 180\u00b0.\nThis is incorrect for two reasons:\n* Firstly, angle measurements are only defined up to an additive constant of [[degree (angle)|360\u00b0]] (or 2\u03c0, if measuring in [[radian]]s). Thus one could as easily call these 1\u00b0 and \u22121\u00b0, or 361\u00b0 and 719\u00b0, each of which gives a different average.\n* Secondly, in this situation, 0\u00b0 (equivalently, 360\u00b0) is geometrically a better ''average'' value: there is lower [[statistical dispersion|dispersion]] about it (the points are both 1\u00b0 from it, and 179\u00b0 from 180\u00b0, the putative average).\n\nIn general application, such an oversight will lead to the average value artificially moving towards the middle of the numerical range. A solution to this problem is to use the optimization formulation ([[viz.]], define the mean as the central point: the point about which one has the lowest dispersion), and redefine the difference as a modular distance (i.e., the distance on the circle: so the modular distance between 1\u00b0 and 359\u00b0 is 2\u00b0, not 358\u00b0).\n\n==See also==\n* [[Average]]\n* [[Fr\u00e9chet mean]]\n* [[Generalized mean]]\n* [[Geometric mean]]\n* [[Mode (statistics)|Mode]]\n* [[Sample mean and covariance]]\n* [[Standard error of the mean]]\n* [[Summary statistics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book| last = Huff| first = Darrell| title = How to Lie with Statistics| year = 1993| publisher = W.

Two of these games are assigned on the basis of a particular team's final divisional standing from the previous season. The remaining 8 games are split between the roster of two other NFL divisions. This assignment shifts each year and will follow a standard cycle. Using the 2012 regular season schedule as an example, each team in the AFC West plays against every team in the AFC North and NFC South. In this way, non-divisional competition will be mostly among common opponents \u2013 the exception being the two games assigned based on the team's prior-season divisional standing.\n\nAt the end of each season, the top six teams in the conference proceeds into the [[National Football League playoffs|playoff]]. These teams consist of the four division winners and the top two [[Wild card (sports)|wild card]] teams. The AFC playoffs culminate in the [[AFC Championship Game]] with the winner receiving the [[Lamar Hunt]] Trophy. The AFC Champion then plays the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Champion in the [[Super Bowl]].\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=September 2014}}\n[[File:Oldafclogo.JPG|thumb|right|150px|Original American Football Conference logo, based on the AFL logo with blue stars]]\nBoth the AFC and the NFC were created after the NFL [[AFL\u2013NFL merger|merged]] with the [[American Football League]] (AFL) in 1970.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldalmanacforkids.com/WAKI-ViewArticle.aspx?pin=x-fo055624a&article_id=608&chapter_id=13&chapter_title=Sports&article_title=Pro_Football_History|title=Pro Football \u2013 History|accessdate=3 April 2009}}</ref> The AFL began play in 1960 with eight teams, and added two more expansion clubs (the [[Miami Dolphins]] in 1966 and the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] in 1968) before the merger. In order to equalize the number of teams in each conference, three NFL teams that predated the AFL's launch (the [[Cleveland Browns]], [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and the then-[[Baltimore Colts]]) joined the ten former AFL teams to form the AFC. The two AFL divisions [[AFL East]] and [[AFL West]] were more or less intact, while the Century Division, in which the Browns and the Steelers had played since 1967, was moved from the NFL to become the new AFC Central.\n\nSince the merger, five expansion teams have joined the AFC and two have left, thus making the current total 16. When the [[Seattle Seahawks]] and the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] joined the league in 1976, they were temporarily placed in the NFC and AFC respectively. This arrangement lasted for one season only before the two teams switched conferences. The Seahawks eventually returned to the NFC as a result of the [[2002 NFL season#Expansion and realignment|2002 realignment]]. The expansion [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] joined the AFC in 1995. There have been five teams that have relocated at least once. In 1984, the [[History of the Baltimore Colts|Baltimore Colts]] [[Baltimore Colts relocation to Indianapolis|relocated]] to Indianapolis in 1984. In 1995, the [[Cleveland Browns]] had attempted to move to Baltimore, the resulting [[Cleveland Browns relocation controversy|dispute]] between Cleveland and the team, led to Modell establishing the [[Baltimore Ravens]] with the players and personnel from the Browns, while the Browns were placed in suspended operations before they were reinstated by the NFL.\n\nIn California, the [[Oakland Raiders]] relocated to Los Angeles in 1982, and Back to Oakland in 1995, while the [[History of the San Diego Chargers|San Diego Chargers]] moved to Los Angeles in 2017.\n\nThe [[History of the Houston Oilers|Houston Oilers]] moved to [[Tennessee]] in 1997, where they were renamed the Tennessee Oilers. The team would change its name again, two years later, to the [[Tennessee Titans]].\n\nThe NFL would again expand in 2002, adding the [[Houston Texans]] to the AFC.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2016, the AFC has sent either the [[Baltimore Ravens]] (2 times), the [[Denver Broncos]] (2 times), the [[Indianapolis Colts]] (2 times), the [[Oakland Raiders]] (1 time), the [[New England Patriots]] (7 times), and the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] (3 times) to the [[Super Bowl]]. By contrast, the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] has sent 12 different teams during that same time frame. 14 of the last 17 AFC champions have started one of just three quarterbacks - [[Tom Brady]], [[Peyton Manning]], and [[Ben Roethlisberger]] - in the Super Bowl.\n\n==Logo==\n[[Image:American Football Conference logo old.svg|right|thumb|2nd American Football Conference logo used from 1970 to 2009|216x216px]]\nThe merged league created a new logo for the AFC that took elements of the old AFL logo, specifically the \"A\" and the six stars surrounding it. The AFC logo basically remained unchanged from 1970 to 2009. The 2010 NFL season introduced an updated AFC logo, with the most notable revision being the removal of two stars (leaving four representing the four divisions of the AFC), and moving the stars inside the letter, similar to the NFC logo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |title=But I Absolutely Refuse to Write About the Draft Caps |author=Paul Lukas |publisher=Uni Watch blog |accessdate=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506134900/http://www.uniwatchblog.com/2010/03/02/but-i-absolutely-refuse-to-write-about-the-draft-caps/ |archivedate=6 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{NFL}}\n{{Navboxes|list=\n{{Buffalo Bills}}\n{{Miami Dolphins}}\n{{New England Patriots}}\n{{New York Jets}}\n{{Baltimore Ravens}}\n{{Cincinnati Bengals}}\n{{Cleveland Browns}}\n{{Pittsburgh Steelers}}\n{{Houston Texans}}\n{{Indianapolis Colts}}\n{{Jacksonville Jaguars}}\n{{Tennessee Titans}}\n{{Denver Broncos}}\n{{Kansas City Chiefs}}\n{{Los Angeles Chargers}}\n{{Oakland Raiders}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:National Football League]]\n[[Category:American Football League|Conference]]\n[[Category:Sports organisations established in 1970]]", "sha1": "5c03hbzyprl6cqemw93gzzgetpcm335"}}, {"title": "Albert Gore", "ns": "0", "id": "617", "redirect": {"title": "Al Gore"}, "revision": {"id": "783824698", "parentid": "332508764", "timestamp": "2017-06-04T22:06:44Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{R category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#redirect [[Al Gore]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from full name}}\n}}", "sha1": "qqxhnykrdapjtt7nxre5y7neguz3bjx"}}, {"title": "AnEnquiryConcerningHumanUnderstanding", "ns": "0", "id": "618", "redirect": {"title": "An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding"}, "revision": {"id": "783824707", "parentid": "427328657", "timestamp": "2017-06-04T22:06:49Z", "contributor": {"username": "Tom.Reding", "id": "9784415"}, "minor": "", "comment": "+{{R category shell}} using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "#REDIRECT [[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]\n\n{{Redirect category shell|1=\n{{R from CamelCase}}\n}}", "sha1": "oe9jtpfh7qyawpzt0zv3ridkfl9snvk"}}, {"title": "Animal Farm", "ns": "0", "id": "620", "revision": {"id": "795805797", "parentid": "795650823", "timestamp": "2017-08-16T16:00:17Z", "contributor": {"username": "Doniago", "id": "7021758"}, "minor": "", "comment": "[[Help:Reverting|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/Tommyt|Tommyt]] ([[User talk:Tommyt|talk]]) to last version by Sammimack don't add speculation", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{About|the novel by George Orwell}}\n{{Pp-semi-indef}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2011}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name         = Animal Farm\n| title_orig   = Animal Farm: A Fairy Story\n| image        = Animal Farm - 1st edition.jpg\n| caption      = First edition cover\n| author       = [[George Orwell]]\n| illustrator  =\n| cover_artist =\n| country      = United Kingdom\n| language     = English\n| genre        = Political satire\n| published    = 17 August 1945 ([[Secker and Warburg]], London, England)\n| media_type   = Print (hardback & paperback)\n| pages        = 112 (UK paperback edition) <!-- First edition page count preferred -->\n| isbn        = <!-- First released before ISBN system implemented -->\n| dewey        = 823/.912 20\n| congress     = PR6029.R8 A63 2003b\n| oclc         = 53163540\n}}\n\n'''''Animal Farm''''' is an [[allegory|allegorical]] novella by [[George Orwell]], first published in England on 17 August 1945.

In a letter to Yvonne Davet, Orwell described ''Animal Farm'' as a [[satire|satirical]] tale against Stalin (\"''un conte satirique contre Staline''\"),{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} and in his essay \"[[Why I Write]]\" (1946), wrote that ''Animal Farm'' was the first book in which he tried, with full consciousness of what he was doing, \"to fuse political purpose and artistic purpose into one whole\".\n\nThe original title was ''Animal Farm: A Fairy Story;'' U.S. publishers dropped the subtitle when it was published in 1946, and only one of the translations during Orwell's lifetime kept it. Other titular variations include subtitles like \"''A Satire''\" and \"''A Contemporary Satire''\".{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}} Orwell suggested the title ''Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes animales'' for the French translation, which abbreviates to URSA, the [[Latin]] word for \"bear\", a [[Russian bear|symbol of Russia]]. It also played on the French name of the Soviet Union, ''Union des r\u00e9publiques socialistes sovi\u00e9tiques''.{{sfn|Davison|2000|p=}}\n\nOrwell wrote the book between November 1943 and February 1944, when the UK was in its wartime alliance with the Soviet Union and the British people and intelligentsia held Stalin in high esteem, a phenomenon Orwell hated.<ref>[[Bradbury, Malcolm]], Introduction, p.&nbsp;vi, ''Animal Farm'', Penguin edition, 1989</ref> The manuscript was initially rejected by a number of British and American publishers,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historytoday.com/robert-pearce/animal-farm-sixty-years|title=Animal Farm: Sixty Years On|work=historytoday.com}}</ref> including one of Orwell's own, [[Victor Gollancz]], which delayed its publication. It became a great commercial success when it did appear partly because international relations were transformed as the wartime alliance gave way to the [[Cold War]].<ref>Dickstein, Morris. ''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&nbsp;134</ref>\n\n''Time'' magazine chose the book as one of the 100 best English-language novels (1923 to 2005);{{sfn|Grossman|Lacayo|2005|p=}} it also featured at number 31 on the [[Modern Library List of Best 20th-Century Novels]]. It won a Retrospective [[Hugo Award]] in 1996, and is included in the [[Great Books of the Western World]] selection.\n\n== Plot summary ==\n[[Old Major]], the old boar on the Manor Farm, summons the animals on the farm together for a meeting, during which he refers to humans as \"enemies\" and teaches the animals a revolutionary song called \"[[Beasts of England]]\". When Major dies, two young pigs, [[Snowball (Animal Farm)|Snowball]] and [[Napoleon (Animal Farm)|Napoleon]], assume command and consider it a duty to prepare for the Rebellion. The animals revolt and drive the drunken and irresponsible farmer [[Jones (Animal Farm)|Mr. Jones]] from the farm, renaming it \"Animal Farm\". They adopt the Seven Commandments of Animalism, the most important of which is, \"All animals are equal.\"\n\nSnowball teaches the animals to read and write, while Napoleon educates young puppies on the principles of [[#Animalism|Animalism]].  Food is plentiful, and the farm runs smoothly.  The pigs elevate themselves to positions of leadership and set aside special food items, ostensibly for their personal health.\n\nSome time later, several men attack Animal Farm. Jones and his men are making an attempt to recapture the farm, aided by several other farmers who are terrified of similar animal revolts. Snowball and the animals, who are hiding in ambush, defeat the men by launching a surprise attack as soon as they enter the farmyard. Snowball's popularity soars, and this event is proclaimed \"The Battle of the Cowshed\". It is celebrated annually with the firing of a gun, on the anniversary of the Revolution.\n\nNapoleon and Snowball vie for pre-eminence. When Snowball announces his plans to modernize the farm by building a [[windmill]], Napoleon has his dogs chase Snowball away and declares himself leader.\n\nNapoleon enacts changes to the governance structure of the farm, replacing meetings with a committee of pigs who will run the farm. Through a young pig named [[Squealer (Animal Farm)|Squealer]], Napoleon claims credit for the windmill idea. The animals work harder with the promise of easier lives with the windmill. When the animals find the windmill collapsed after a violent storm, Napoleon and Squealer convince the animals that Snowball is trying to sabotage their project. Once Snowball becomes a [[scapegoat]], Napoleon begins to [[purge]] the farm with his dogs, killing animals he accuses of consorting with his old rival. When some animals recall the Battle of the Cowshed, Napoleon (who was nowhere to be found during the battle) frequently smears Snowball as a collaborator of Jones', while falsely representing himself as the hero of the battle. \"Beasts of England\" is replaced with an anthem glorifying Napoleon, who appears to be adopting the lifestyle of a man. The animals remain convinced that they are better off than they were under Mr. Jones.\n\n[[Frederick (Animal Farm)|Mr Frederick]], one of the neighbouring farmers, attacks the farm, using [[Explosive material|blasting powder]] to blow up the restored windmill. Though the animals win the battle, they do so [[Pyrrhic victory|at great cost]], as many, including [[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]] the workhorse, are wounded. Despite his injuries, Boxer continues working harder and harder, until he collapses while working on the windmill. Napoleon sends for a van to take Boxer to the veterinary surgeon, explaining that better care can be given there. Benjamin, the cynical donkey who \"could read as well as any pig\",<ref>{{cite book|author=Orwell, George |date=1946|title=Animal Farm|location= London|publisher= Penguin Group|page=21}}</ref> notices that the van belongs to a [[knacker]] and attempts a futile rescue. Squealer quickly assures the animals that the van had been purchased from the knacker by an animal hospital, and the previous owner's signboard had not been repainted. In a subsequent report, Squealer reports sadly to the animals that Boxer died peacefully at the animal hospital; the pigs hold a festival one day after Boxer's death to further praise the glories of Animal Farm and have the animals work harder by taking on Boxer's ways. However, the truth was that Napoleon had engineered the sale of Boxer to the knacker, allowing him and his inner circle to acquire money to buy [[whisky]] for themselves. (In 1940s England, one way for farms to make money was to sell large animals to a knacker, who would kill the animal and boil its remains into [[animal glue]].)\n\n{{anchor|moreEqual}}\nYears pass, and the windmill is rebuilt along with construction of another windmill, which makes the farm a good amount of income. However, the ideals which Snowball discussed, including stalls with electric lighting, heating and running water are forgotten, with Napoleon advocating that the happiest animals live simple lives. In addition to Boxer, many of the animals who participated in the Revolution are dead, as is Farmer Jones, who died in another part of England. The pigs start to resemble humans, as they walk upright, carry whips, and wear clothes. The Seven Commandments are abridged to a single phrase: \"All animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others\". Napoleon holds a dinner party for the pigs and local farmers, with whom he celebrates a new alliance. He abolishes the practice of the revolutionary traditions and restores the name \"The Manor Farm\". As the animals look from pigs to humans, they realise they can no longer distinguish between the two.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Pigs===\n\n*'''[[Old Major]]''' \u2013 An aged prize [[Middle White|Middle White boar]] provides the inspiration that fuels the rebellion.

The animals of Animal Farm are terrified of Frederick, as rumours abound of him abusing his animals and entertaining himself with [[cockfighting]] (a likely allegory for the human rights abuses of [[Adolf Hitler]]). Napoleon enters into an alliance with Frederick in order to sell surplus timber that Pilkington also sought, but is enraged to learn Frederick paid him in counterfeit money. Shortly after the swindling, Frederick and his men invade Animal Farm, killing many animals and detonating the windmill. The brief alliance and subsequent invasion may allude to the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] and [[Operation Barbarossa]].\n*'''[[Pilkington (Animal Farm)|Mr Pilkington]]''' \u2013 The easy-going but crafty and well-to-do owner of Foxwood, a large neighbouring farm overgrown with weeds. Unlike Frederick, Pilkington is wealthier and owns more land, but his farm is in need of care as opposed to Frederick's smaller but more efficiently-run farm. Although on bad terms with Frederick, Pilkington is also concerned about the animal revolution that deposed Jones, and worried that this could also happen to him.\n*'''Mr Whymper''' \u2013 A man hired by Napoleon to act as the liaison between Animal Farm and human society. At first he is used to acquire necessities that cannot be produced on the farm, such as dog biscuits and [[paraffin wax]], but later he procures luxuries like alcohol for the pigs.\n\n===Horses and donkeys ===\n\n*'''[[Boxer (Animal Farm)|Boxer]]''' \u2013 A loyal, kind, dedicated, extremely strong, hard working, and respectable cart-horse, although quite naive and gullible. Boxer does a large share of the physical labour on the farm. He is shown to hold the belief that 'Napoleon is always right'. At one point, he had challenged Squealer's statement that Snowball was always against the welfare of the farm, earning him an attack from Napoleon's dogs. But Boxer's immense strength repels the attack, worrying the pigs that their authority can be challenged. Boxer has been compared to the [[Stakhanovite movement]]. He has been described as \"faithful and strong\";<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=30047391|pages=17\u201319|last1=Sutherland|first1=T.|title=Speaking My Mind: Orwell Farmed for Education|volume=95|issue=1|journal=The English Journal|year=2005}}</ref> he believes any problem can be solved if he works harder.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=40176954|pages=11\u201363|last1=Roper|first1=D.|title=Viewpoint 2: The Boxer Mentality|volume=9|issue=11|journal=Change|year=1977|doi=10.1080/00091383.1977.10569271}}</ref> When Boxer is injured, Napoleon sells him to a local [[knacker]] to buy himself whisky, and Squealer gives a moving account falsifying Boxer's death.\n*'''Mollie''' \u2013 A self-centred, self-indulgent and vain young white mare who quickly leaves for another farm after the revolution. She is only once mentioned again, in a manner similar to those who left Russia after the fall of the Tsar.\n*'''Clover''' \u2013 A gentle, caring female horse, who shows concern especially for Boxer, who often pushes himself too hard. Clover can read all the letters of the alphabet, but cannot \"put words together\". She seems to catch on to the sly tricks and schemes set up by Napoleon and Squealer.\n*'''[[Benjamin (Animal Farm)|Benjamin]]''' \u2013 A donkey, one of the oldest, wisest animals on the farm, and one of the few who can read properly. He is sceptical, temperamental and cynical: his most frequent remark is, \"Life will go on as it has always gone on\u2014that is, badly.\"<ref name=\"Orwell 1946 40\" /> The academic Morris Dickstein has suggested there is \"a touch of Orwell himself in this creature's timeless skepticism\"<ref name=Dickstein141>''Cambridge Companion to Orwell'', p.&nbsp;141</ref> and indeed, friends called Orwell \"Donkey George\", \"after his grumbling donkey Benjamin, in ''Animal Farm''.\"<ref>''The Lost Orwell'', p.&nbsp;236</ref>\n\n===Other animals===\n*'''Muriel''' \u2013 A wise old goat who is friends with all of the animals on the farm. She, like Benjamin and Snowball, is one of the few animals on the farm who can read.\n*'''The puppies''' \u2013 Offspring of Jessie and Bluebell, they were taken away at birth by Napoleon and reared by him to be his security force.\n*'''Moses''' \u2013 The raven, \"Mr. Jones's especial pet, was a spy and a tale-bearer, but he was also a clever talker.\" Initially following Mrs. Jones into exile, he reappears several years later and resumes his role of talking but not working. He regales Animal Farm's denizens with tales of a wondrous place beyond the clouds called \"Sugarcandy Mountain, that happy country where we poor animals shall rest forever from our labours!\" Orwell portrays [[Religion and politics|established religion]] as \"the black raven of priestcraft\u2014promising pie in the sky when you die, and faithfully serving whoever happens to be in power.\" Napoleon brings the raven back (Ch. IX), as Stalin brought back the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].<ref name=Dickstein141/> \n*'''The sheep''' \u2013 They show limited understanding of the Animalism and the political atmosphere of the farm; yet nonetheless they blindly support Napoleon's ideals with vocal jingles during his speeches and meetings with Snowball. Some commentators<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07wgkz4 Professor Robert Colls (Cultural History, De Montfort University) BBC In Our Time's episode on Animal Farm]</ref> have compared the sheep to representations of state controlled press. Their constant bleating of \"four legs good, two legs bad\" was used as a device to drown out any opposition; analogous to simplistic headlines used in printed media of the age. Towards the latter section of the book, Squealer (the propagandist) trains the sheep to alter their slogan to \"four legs good, two legs better\", which they dutifully do. Symbolizing the state manipulation of media.\n*'''The hens''' \u2013 The hens are promised at the start of the revolution that they will get to keep their eggs, which are stolen from them under Mr Jones. However their eggs are soon taken from them under the premise of buying goods from outside Animal Farm. The hens are among the first to rebel against Napoleon.\n*'''The cows''' \u2013 The cows are enticed into the revolution by promises that their milk will not be stolen, but can be used to raise their own calves. Their milk is then stolen by the pigs, who learn to milk them. The milk is stirred into the pigs' mash every day, while the other animals are denied such luxuries. \n*'''The cat''' \u2013 Never seen to carry out any work, the cat is absent for long periods and is forgiven; because her excuses are so convincing and she \"purred so affectionately that it was impossible not to believe in her good intentions.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/> She has no interest in the politics of the farm, and the only time she is recorded as having participated in an election, she is found to have actually \"voted on both sides.\"<ref name=autogenerated1/>\n\n==Composition and publication==\n\n===Origin===\nGeorge Orwell wrote the manuscript in 1943 and 1944 subsequent to his experiences during the [[Spanish Civil War]], which he described in ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'' (1938). In the preface of a 1947 Ukrainian edition of ''Animal Farm'', he explained how escaping the communist purges in Spain taught him \"how easily totalitarian propaganda can control the opinion of enlightened people in democratic countries\". This motivated Orwell to expose and strongly condemn what he saw as the [[Stalinist]] corruption of the original socialist ideals.{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}\n\nImmediately prior to writing the book, Orwell had quit the [[BBC]]. He was also upset about a booklet for propagandists the Ministry of Information had put out. The booklet included instructions on how to quell ideological fears of the Soviet Union, such as directions to claim that the Red Terror was a figment of Nazi imagination.<ref>[[Overy, Richard]], ''Why the Allies Won'', p.&nbsp;297 {{ISBN|0-393-03925-0}}</ref>\n\nIn the preface, Orwell also described the source of the idea of setting the book on a farm:{{sfn|Orwell|1947|p=}}\n{{quote\n| ...I saw a little boy, perhaps ten years old, driving a huge carthorse along a narrow path, whipping it whenever it tried to turn. It struck me that if only such animals became aware of their strength we should have no power over them, and that men exploit animals in much the same way as the rich exploit the proletariat.\n}}\n\n===Efforts to find a publisher===\nOrwell initially encountered difficulty getting the manuscript published, largely due to fears that the book might upset the alliance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Four publishers refused; one had initially accepted the work but declined it after consulting the [[Ministry of Information (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Information]].{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}}<ref>[[#GOIT|Orwell 1976 page 25 ''La libert\u00e0 di stampa'']]</ref> Eventually, [[Secker and Warburg]] published the first edition in 1945.\n\nDuring the [[World War II|Second World War]], it became clear to Orwell that anti-Soviet literature was not something which most major publishing houses would touch\u2014including his regular publisher [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]. He also submitted the manuscript to [[Faber and Faber]], where the poet [[T. S. Eliot]] (who was a director of the firm) rejected it; Eliot wrote back to Orwell praising the book's \"good writing\" and \"fundamental integrity\", but declared that they would only accept it for publication if they had some sympathy for the viewpoint \"which I take to be generally [[Deformed workers' state|Trotskyite]]\". Eliot said he found the view \"not convincing\", and contended that the pigs were made out to be the best to run the farm; he posited that someone might argue \"what was needed... was not more communism but more public-spirited pigs\".<ref name=Eliot/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://archive.timesonline.co.uk/tol/viewArticle.arc?articleId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09-004&pageId=ARCHIVE-The_Times-1969-01-06-09|title=T.S.

Anti-Russian books do appear, but mostly from Catholic publishing firms and always from a religious or frankly reactionary angle.\"\n\nThe publisher [[Jonathan Cape]], who had initially accepted ''Animal Farm'', subsequently rejected the book after an official at the British Ministry of Information warned him off<ref name=bbc/>\u2014although the civil servant who it is assumed gave the order was later found to be a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spy.{{sfn|Taylor|2003|p=337}} Writing to [[Leonard Moore (literary agent)|Leonard Moore]], a partner in the literary agency of Christy & Moore, publisher Jonathan Cape explained that the decision had been taken on the advice of a senior official in the Ministry of Information. Such flagrant anti-Soviet bias was unacceptable, and the choice of pigs as the dominant class was thought to be especially offensive. It may reasonably be assumed that the 'important official' was a man named [[Peter Smollett]], who was later unmasked as a Soviet agent.<ref name=\"Orwell Subverted p.3\">''Orwell Subverted'', Daniel J. Leab, Penn State Press, 2007 p.&nbsp;3</ref> Orwell was suspicious of Smollett/Smolka, and he would be one of the names Orwell [[Orwell's list|included in his list]] of Crypto-Communists and Fellow-Travellers sent to the Information Research Department in 1949.

I think the choice of pigs as the ruling caste will no doubt give offence to many people, and particularly to anyone who is a bit touchy, as undoubtedly the Russians are.\n}}\n\n[[Frederic Warburg]] also faced pressures against publication, even from people in his own office and from his wife Pamela, who felt that it was not the moment for ingratitude towards Stalin and the heroic [[Red Army]],<ref>''George Orwell, A Personal Memoir'', T. R. Fyvel, p.&nbsp;139</ref> which had played a major part in defeating Hitler. A Russian translation was printed in the paper ''Posev'', and in giving permission for a Russian translation of ''Animal Farm'', Orwell refused in advance all royalties. A translation in Ukrainian, which was produced in Germany, was confiscated in large part by the American wartime authorities and handed over to the Soviet repatriation commission.<ref>[[Struve, Gleb]]. ''Telling the Russians'', written for the Russian journal ''New Russian Wind'', reprinted in Remembering Orwell, pp.260\u201361</ref>\n\nIn October 1945, Orwell wrote to Frederic Warburg expressing interest in pursuing the possibility that the political cartoonist [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]] might illustrate ''Animal Farm''. Low had written a letter saying that he had had \"a good time with ''ANIMAL FARM''\u2014an excellent bit of satire\u2014it would illustrate perfectly.\" Nothing came of this, and a trial issue produced by Secker & Warburg in 1956 illustrated by John Driver was abandoned, but the [[Folio Society]] published an edition in 1984 illustrated by [[Quentin Blake]] and an edition illustrated by the cartoonist [[Ralph Steadman]] was published by Secker & Warburg in 1995 to celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of the first edition of ''Animal Farm''.<ref>Smothered Under Journalism, p. 123 & I Belong to the Left, pp. 313\u201314</ref>\n\n===Preface===\nOrwell originally wrote a preface complaining about British [[self-censorship]] and how the British people were suppressing criticism of the USSR, their World War II ally:\n{{quote|The sinister fact about literary censorship in England is that it is largely voluntary.... Things are kept right out of the British press, not because the Government intervenes but because of a general tacit agreement that 'it wouldn't do' to mention that particular fact.}}\nAlthough the first edition allowed space for the preface, it was not included,{{sfn|Dag|2004|p=}} and as of June 2009 most editions of the book have not included it.<ref>[[#Ba|Bailey83221]] (Bailey83221 includes a preface and two cites: 26 August 1995 ''The Guardian'' p. 28; 26 August 1995 ''New Statesman & Society'' 8 (366): 11. {{ISSN|0954-2361}})</ref>\n\nSecker and Warburg published the first edition of ''Animal Farm'' in 1945 without an introduction. However, the publisher had provided space for a preface in the author's proof composited from the manuscript.

Writing in the American ''[[The New Republic|New Republic]]'' magazine, George Soule expressed his disappointment in the book, writing that it \"puzzled and saddened me. It seemed on the whole dull. The allegory turned out to be a creaking machine for saying in a clumsy way things that have been said better directly.\" Soule believed that the animals were not consistent enough with their real world inspirations, and said, \"It seems to me that the failure of this book (commercially it is already assured of tremendous success) arises from the fact that the satire deals not with something the author has experienced, but rather with stereotyped ideas about a country which he probably does not know very well\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/114852/1946-review-george-orwells-animal-farm|title=1946 Review of George Orwell's 'Animal Farm' |author=George Soule|work=The New Republic}}</ref>\n\n''[[The Guardian]]'' on 24 August 1945 called ''Animal Farm'' \"a delightfully humorous and caustic satire on the rule of the many by the few\".<ref name=\"guardian19450824\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/1945/aug/24/georgeorwell.classics|title=Books of the day \u2013 Animal Farm|work=The Guardian|date=24 August 1945|accessdate=17 July 2016}}</ref> [[Tosco Fyvel]], writing in ''[[Tribune (magazine)|Tribune]]'' on the same day, called the book \"a gentle satire on a certain State and on the illusions of an age which may already be behind us.\" [[Julian Symons]] responded, on 7 September, \"Should we not expect, in ''Tribune'' at least, acknowledgement of the fact that it is a satire not at all gentle upon a particular State\u2014Soviet Russia? It seems to me that a reviewer should have the courage to identify Napoleon with Stalin, and Snowball with Trotsky, and express an opinion favourable or unfavourable to the author, upon a political ground. In a hundred years time perhaps, ''Animal Farm'' may be simply a fairy story, today it is a political satire with a good deal of point.\"\n\n''Animal Farm'' has been subject to much comment in the decades since these early remarks.<ref>Orwell, ''Collected Works, I Belong to the Left'', p. 253</ref>\n\n==Analysis==\n\n===Animalism===\n{{redirect|Seven Commandments|the Noahide code|Seven Laws of Noah}}\n\nThe pigs Snowball, Napoleon, and Squealer adapt Old Major's ideas into \"a complete system of thought\", which they formally name Animalism, an allegoric reference to [[Communism]]. Soon after, Napoleon and Squealer partake in activities associated with the humans (drinking alcohol, sleeping in beds, trading), which were explicitly prohibited by the Seven Commandments. Squealer is employed to alter the Seven Commandments to account for this humanisation, an [[allusion]] to the Soviet government's revising of history in order to exercise control of the people's beliefs about themselves and their society.<ref name=Rodden1999/>\n[[File:Animal Farm artwork.jpg|thumb|Squealer sprawls at the foot of the end wall of the big barn where the Seven Commandments were written (ch. viii) \u2013 preliminary artwork for a 1950 strip cartoon by [[Norman Pett]] and Donald Freeman]]\n\nThe original commandments are:\n# Whatever goes upon two legs is an enemy.\n# Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.\n# No animal shall wear clothes.\n# No animal shall sleep in a bed.\n# No animal shall drink alcohol.\n# No animal shall kill any other animal.\n# All animals are equal.\n\nThese commandments are also distilled into the maxim \"Four legs good, two legs '''bad!'''\" which is primarily used by the sheep on the farm, often to disrupt discussions and disagreements between animals on the nature of Animalism.\n\nLater, Napoleon and his pigs secretly revise some commandments to clear themselves of accusations of law-breaking. The changed commandments are as follows, with the changes bolded:\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>No animal shall sleep in a bed '''with sheets.'''</li>\n<li>No animal shall drink alcohol '''to excess.'''</li>\n<li>No animal shall kill any other animal '''without cause.'''</li>\n</ol>\nEventually, these are replaced with the maxims, \"All animals are equal '''but some animals are more equal than others'''\", and \"Four legs good, two legs '''better!'''\" as the pigs become more human. This is an [[Irony|ironic]] twist to the original purpose of the Seven Commandments, which were supposed to keep order within Animal Farm by uniting the animals together against the humans and preventing animals from following the humans' evil habits. Through the revision of the commandments, Orwell demonstrates how simply political [[dogma]] can be turned into malleable [[propaganda]].<ref name=Carr2010/>\n\n===Significance and allegory===\n[[File:Animalism flag.svg|thumb|left|The Horn and Hoof Flag described in the book appears to be based on the [[hammer and sickle]], the Communist symbol.]]\n\nIn the [[Eastern Bloc]], both ''Animal Farm'' and later ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' were on the list of forbidden books until the [[Revolutions of 1989|end of communist rule in 1989]], and were only available via clandestine [[Samizdat]] networks.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}\n\nOrwell biographer Jeffrey Meyers has written, \"virtually every detail has political significance in this allegory.\" Orwell himself wrote in 1946, \"Of course I intended it primarily as a satire on the Russian revolution..[and] ''that kind'' of revolution (violent conspiratorial revolution, led by unconsciously power hungry people) can only lead to a change of masters [-] revolutions only effect a radical improvement when the masses are alert.\"<ref name=OrwellLIL334/> In a preface for a 1947 Ukrainian edition, he stated, \"...&nbsp;for the past ten years I have been convinced that the destruction of the Soviet myth was essential if we wanted a revival of the socialist movement.

''Orwell, A Life'', p.&nbsp;450</ref>\n\nThe revolt of the animals against Farmer Jones is Orwell's analogy with the [[October Revolution|October 1917 Bolshevik Revolution]]. The ''Battle of the Cowshed'' has been said to represent the [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|allied invasion]] of [[Russian SFSR|Soviet Russia]] in 1918,<ref name=\"Peter Hobley Davison 1996\" /> and the defeat of the [[White movement|White Russians]] in the [[Russian Civil War]].<ref name=\"Peter Edgerly Firchow 2008\" /> The pigs' rise to pre-eminence mirrors the rise of a Stalinist bureaucracy in the USSR, just as Napoleon's emergence as the farm's sole leader reflects Stalin's emergence. The pigs' appropriation of milk and apples for their own use, \"the turning point of the story\" as Orwell termed it in a letter to [[Dwight Macdonald]],<ref name=OrwellLIL334>Orwell, George.

Modern amphibians are all [[Lissamphibia]]. They inhabit a wide variety of [[habitat]]s, with most species living within [[terrestrial animal|terrestrial]], [[fossorial]], [[arboreal]] or freshwater [[Aquatic animal|aquatic]] [[ecosystem]]s. Thus amphibians typically start out as [[larva]]e living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo [[metamorphosis]] from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with [[lung]]s. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial [[salamander]]s and [[frog]]s lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to [[lizard]]s but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are [[amniote]]s and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often [[ecological indicator]]s; in recent decades there has been a dramatic [[decline in amphibian populations]] for many species around the globe.\n\nThe earliest amphibians [[evolution of tetrapods|evolved]] in the [[Devonian]] period from [[sarcopterygian]] fish with lungs and bony-limbed fins, features that were helpful in adapting to dry land. They diversified and became dominant during the [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] periods, but were later displaced by reptiles and other vertebrates. Over time, amphibians shrank in size and decreased in diversity, leaving only the modern subclass [[Lissamphibia]].\n\nThe three modern orders of amphibians are [[Anura (frog)|Anura]] (the frogs and toads), [[Urodela]] (the salamanders), and [[caecilian|Apoda]] (the caecilians). The number of known amphibian species is approximately 7,000, of which nearly 90% are frogs. The smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') with a length of just {{convert|7.7|mm|in|abbr=on}}. The largest living amphibian is the {{convert|1.8|m|0|abbr=on}} [[Chinese giant salamander]] (''Andrias davidianus''), but this is dwarfed by the extinct {{convert|9|m|0|abbr=on}} ''[[Prionosuchus]]'' from the middle Permian of Brazil. The study of amphibians is called [[batrachology]], while the study of both reptiles and amphibians is called [[herpetology]].\n\n== Classification ==\n{{see also|List of amphibians}}\n[[File:Paratype of Paedophryne amauensis (LSUMZ 95004).png|thumb|alt=World's smallest vertebrate|The world's smallest known vertebrate, ''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'', sitting on a [[Dime (United States coin)|U.S. dime]], which is 17.9&nbsp;mm in diameter, for scale]]\n\nThe word \"amphibian\" is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] term \u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (''amph\u00edbios''), which means \"both kinds of life\", ''\u1f00\u03bc\u03c6\u03af'' meaning \"of both kinds\" and ''\u03b2\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2'' meaning \"life\".

Classification varies according to the preferred phylogeny of the author and whether they use a [[Cladistics#Three definitions of clade|stem-based or a node-based]] classification. Traditionally, amphibians as a class are defined as all tetrapods with a larval stage, while the group that includes the common ancestors of all living amphibians (frogs, salamanders and caecilians) and all their descendants is called Lissamphibia. The phylogeny of Paleozoic amphibians is uncertain, and Lissamphibia may possibly fall within extinct groups, like the Temnospondyli (traditionally placed in the subclass Labyrinthodontia) or the Lepospondyli, and in some analyses even in the amniotes. This means that advocates of [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] have removed a large number of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] Devonian and Carboniferous amphibian-type tetrapod groups that were formerly placed in Amphibia in [[Linnaean taxonomy]], and included them elsewhere under [[cladistic taxonomy]].<ref name=BlackburnWake>{{cite journal|author1=Blackburn, D.

The briefness of this period, and the swiftness with which radiation took place, would help account for the relative scarcity of primitive amphibian fossils.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=San Mauro, Diego |author2=Vences, Miguel |author3=Alcobendas, Marina |author4=Zardoya, Rafael |author5=Meyer, Axel |year=2005 |title=Initial diversification of living amphibians predated the breakup of Pangaea |journal=The American Naturalist |volume=165 |issue=5 |pages=590\u2013599 |doi=10.1086/429523 |pmid=15795855 |url=http://nbn-resolving.de/urn:nbn:de:bsz:352-opus-33053 }}</ref> There are large gaps in the [[fossil record]], but the discovery of a proto-frog from the Early Permian in Texas in 2008 provided a missing link with many of the characteristics of modern frogs.

In the water, the sideways thrusts of their tails had propelled them forward, but on land, quite different mechanisms were required. Their vertebral columns, limbs, limb girdles and musculature needed to be strong enough to raise them off the ground for locomotion and feeding. Terrestrial adults discarded their [[lateral line]] systems and adapted their sensory systems to receive stimuli via the medium of the air. They needed to develop new methods to regulate their body heat to cope with fluctuations in ambient temperature. They developed behaviours suitable for reproduction in a terrestrial environment. Their skins were exposed to harmful [[ultraviolet]] rays that had previously been absorbed by the water. The skin changed to become more protective and prevent excessive water loss.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843\u2013859 }}\n\n== Characteristics ==\nThe superclass [[Tetrapoda]] is divided into four classes of vertebrate animals with four limbs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Terrestrial_Vertebrates/14952 |title=Terrestrial Vertebrates |author=Laurin, Michel |year=2011 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> Reptiles, birds and mammals are amniotes, the eggs of which are either laid or carried by the female and are surrounded by several membranes, some of which are impervious.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://tolweb.org/Amniota/14990 |title=Amniota |author1=Laurin, Michel |author2=Gauthier, Jacques A. |year=2012 |work=Tree of Life Web Project |accessdate=September 16, 2012}}</ref> Lacking these membranes, amphibians require water bodies for reproduction, although some species have developed various strategies for protecting or bypassing the vulnerable aquatic larval stage.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843\u2013859 }} They are not found in the sea with the exception of one or two frogs that live in [[brackish water]] in [[mangrove]] swamps.<ref>{{cite book |title=Introduction to the Biology of Marine Life |last=Sumich |first=James L. |author2= Morrissey, John F. |year=2004 |publisher=Jones & Bartlett Learning |isbn=978-0-7637-3313-1 |page=171 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y8vTCze3dHgC&dq=%22+amphibians+in+the+sea%3F%22&q=Amphibians#v=snippet&q=Amphibians&f=false }}</ref> On land, amphibians are restricted to moist habitats because of the need to keep their skin damp.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | pp=843\u2013859 }}\n\nThe smallest amphibian (and vertebrate) in the world is a [[microhylid]] frog from [[New Guinea]] (''[[Paedophryne amauensis]]'') first discovered in 2012.

In the adult state, they have tear ducts and movable eyelids, and most species have ears that can detect airborne or ground vibrations. They have muscular tongues, which in many species can be protruded. Modern amphibians have fully [[Ossification|ossified]] vertebrae with [[articular processes]]. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little [[keratin]] and lacks scales, apart from a few fish-like scales in certain caecilians. The skin contains many [[mucous gland]]s and in some species, [[Skin|poison glands]] (a type of granular gland). The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two [[atrium (heart)|atria]] and one [[ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]. They have a [[urinary bladder]] and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as [[urea]]. Most amphibians lay their eggs in water and have aquatic larvae that undergo metamorphosis to become terrestrial adults.

These three cell layers consist of the melanophores (occupying the deepest layer), the guanophores (forming an intermediate layer and containing many granules, producing a blue-green colour) and the lipophores (yellow, the most superficial layer). The colour change displayed by many species is initiated by [[hormone]]s secreted by the pituitary gland. Unlike bony fish, there is no direct control of the pigment cells by the nervous system, and this results in the colour change taking place more slowly than happens in fish. A vividly coloured skin usually indicates that the species is toxic and is a warning sign to predators.<ref>{{cite book |title=The Integument: A Textbook of Skin Biology |last=Spearman |first=R. I.

They all have four limbs except for the legless caecilians and a few species of salamander with reduced or no limbs. The bones are hollow and lightweight. The musculoskeletal system is strong to enable it to support the head and body. The bones are fully [[ossification|ossified]] and the vertebrae interlock with each other by means of overlapping processes. The [[pectoral girdle]] is supported by muscle, and the well-developed [[pelvic girdle]] is attached to the backbone by a pair of sacral ribs. The [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] slopes forward and the body is held closer to the ground than is the case in mammals.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }}\n\n[[File:Ceratophrys cornuta skeleton front.jpg|thumb|alt=Frog skeleton|Skeleton of the [[Surinam horned frog]]<br>(''Ceratophrys cornuta'')]]\nIn most amphibians, there are four digits on the fore foot and five on the hind foot, but no claws on either. Some salamanders have fewer digits and the [[amphiuma]]s are eel-like in appearance with tiny, stubby legs. The [[Siren (genus)|sirens]] are aquatic salamanders with stumpy forelimbs and no hind limbs. The caecilians are limbless. They burrow in the manner of earthworms with zones of muscle contractions moving along the body. On the surface of the ground or in water they move by undulating their body from side to side.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26\u201336 }}\n\nIn frogs, the hind legs are larger than the fore legs, especially so in those species that principally move by jumping or swimming. In the walkers and runners the hind limbs are not so large, and the burrowers mostly have short limbs and broad bodies. The feet have adaptations for the way of life, with webbing between the toes for swimming, broad adhesive toe pads for climbing, and keratinised tubercles on the hind feet for digging (frogs usually dig backwards into the soil). In most salamanders, the limbs are short and more or less the same length and project at right angles from the body. Locomotion on land is by walking and the tail often swings from side to side or is used as a prop, particularly when climbing. In their normal gait, only one leg is advanced at a time in the manner adopted by their ancestors, the lobe-finned fish.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} Some salamanders in the genus ''[[Aneides]]'' and certain [[lungless salamander|plethodontids]] climb trees and have long limbs, large toepads and prehensile tails.<ref name=\"BritCaudata\" /> In aquatic salamanders and in frog tadpoles, the tail has [[dorsal fin|dorsal]] and [[ventral fin|ventral]] fins and is moved from side to side as a means of propulsion. Adult frogs do not have tails and caecilians have only very short ones.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=26\u201336 }}\n\nSalamanders use their tails in defence and some are prepared to jettison them to save their lives in a process known as [[autotomy]]. Certain species in the Plethodontidae have a weak zone at the base of the tail and use this strategy readily. The tail often continues to twitch after separation which may distract the attacker and allow the salamander to escape. Both tails and limbs can be regenerated.<ref name=\"Beneski\">{{cite journal | author=Beneski, John T.

In the juvenile (or tadpole) stage, the circulation is similar to that of a fish; the two-chambered heart pumps the blood through the gills where it is oxygenated, and is spread around the body and back to the heart in a single loop. In the adult stage, amphibians (especially frogs) lose their gills and develop lungs. They have a heart that consists of a single ventricle and two atria. When the ventricle starts contracting, deoxygenated blood is pumped through the [[pulmonary artery]] to the lungs. Continued contraction then pumps oxygenated blood around the rest of the body. Mixing of the two bloodstreams is minimized by the anatomy of the chambers.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=306 }}\n\n=== Nervous and sensory systems ===\nThe [[nervous system]] is basically the same as in other vertebrates, with a central brain, a spinal cord, and nerves throughout the body. The amphibian brain is less well developed than that of reptiles, birds and mammals but is similar in morphology and function to that of a fish. It is believed amphibians are capable of perceiving [[Pain in amphibians|pain]].  The brain consists of equal parts, [[cerebrum]], [[midbrain]] and [[cerebellum]]. Various parts of the cerebrum process sensory input, such as smell in the olfactory lobe and sight in the optic lobe, and it is additionally the centre of behaviour and learning. The cerebellum is the center of muscular coordination and the [[medulla oblongata]] controls some organ functions including heartbeat and respiration. The brain sends signals through the spinal cord and nerves to regulate activity in the rest of the body. The [[pineal body]], known to regulate sleep patterns in humans, is thought to produce the hormones involved in [[hibernation]] and [[aestivation]] in amphibians.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=100 }}\n\nTadpoles retain the lateral line system of their ancestral fishes, but this is lost in terrestrial adult amphibians. Some caecilians possess [[Electroreception|electroreceptors]] that allow them to locate objects around them when submerged in water. The ears are well developed in frogs. There is no external ear, but the large circular [[Tympanum (anatomy)|eardrum]] lies on the surface of the head just behind the eye. This vibrates and sound is transmitted through a single bone, the [[stapes]], to the inner ear. Only high-frequency sounds like mating calls are heard in this way, but low-frequency noises can be detected through another mechanism.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} There is a patch of specialized haircells, called ''papilla amphibiorum'', in the inner ear capable of detecting deeper sounds. Another feature, unique to frogs and salamanders, is the columella-operculum complex adjoining the auditory capsule which is involved in the transmission of both airborne and seismic signals.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=69 }} The ears of salamanders and caecilians are less highly developed than those of frogs as they do not normally communicate with each other through the medium of sound.<ref name=\"EBAmphibia\" />\n\nThe eyes of tadpoles lack lids, but at metamorphosis, the [[cornea]] becomes more dome-shaped, the [[Lens (anatomy)|lens]] becomes flatter, and [[eyelid]]s and associated glands and ducts develop.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=846 }} The adult eyes are an improvement on invertebrate eyes and were a first step in the development of more advanced vertebrate eyes.

Some use inertial feeding to help them swallow the prey, repeatedly thrusting their head forward sharply causing the food to move backwards in their mouth by [[inertia]]. Most amphibians swallow their prey whole without much chewing so they possess voluminous stomachs. The short [[Esophagus|oesophagus]] is lined with [[Cilium|cilia]] that help to move the food to the stomach and [[mucus]] produced by glands in the mouth and [[pharynx]] eases its passage. The enzyme [[chitinase]] produced in the stomach helps digest the [[chitin]]ous cuticle of arthropod prey.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}\n\nAmphibians possess a [[pancreas]], [[liver]] and [[gall bladder]]. The liver is usually large with two lobes. Its size is determined by its function as a [[glycogen]] and fat storage unit, and may change with the seasons as these reserves are built or used up. [[Adipose tissue]] is another important means of storing energy and this occurs in the abdomen (in internal structures called fat bodies), under the skin and, in some salamanders, in the tail.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=66 }}\n<!--In aquatic amphibians, the liver plays only a small role in processing nitrogen for excretion, and [[ammonia]] is diffused mainly through the skin. The liver of terrestrial amphibians converts ammonia to urea, a less toxic, water-soluble nitrogenous compound, as a means of water conservation. In some species, urea is further converted into [[uric acid]]. [[Bile]] secretions from the liver collect in the gall bladder and flow into the small intestine. In the small intestine, enzymes digest carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Salamanders lack a valve separating the small intestine from the large intestine. Salt and water absorption occur in the large intestine, as well as mucous secretion to aid in the transport of faecal matter, which is passed out through the [[cloaca]].<ref name=\"Anatomy\" />---Omitting this until a more reliable source can be found.--->\n\nThere are two [[kidney]]s located dorsally, near the roof of the body cavity. Their job is to filter the blood of metabolic waste and transport the urine via ureters to the urinary bladder where it is stored before being passed out periodically through the cloacal vent. Larvae and most aquatic adult amphibians excrete the nitrogen as ammonia in large quantities of dilute urine, while terrestrial species, with a greater need to conserve water, excrete the less toxic product urea. Some tree frogs with limited access to water excrete most of their metabolic waste as uric acid.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=849 }}\n\n=== Respiratory system ===\n[[File:Axolotl ganz.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Axolotl|The [[axolotl]] (''Ambystoma mexicanum'') retains its larval form with gills into adulthood]]\nThe lungs in amphibians are primitive compared to those of amniotes, possessing few internal [[alveolar septum|septa]] and large [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]], and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood.

To enable sufficient [[cutaneous respiration]], the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }} Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the [[Telmatobius culeus|Titicaca water frog]] and the [[Cryptobranchus|hellbender salamander]]. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the [[Plethodontidae|plethodontid salamanders]], which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the [[axolotl]]) retaining gills as aquatic adults.{{sfn | Dorit | Walker | Barnes | 1991 | p=847 }}\n\n== Reproduction ==\n{{see also|Sexual selection in amphibians}}\n[[File:Litoria xanthomera amplexus.jpg|thumb|alt=Orange-thighed frogs in amplexus|Male [[orange-thighed frog]] (''Litoria xanthomera'') grasping the female during [[amplexus]]]]\nFor the purpose of [[Biological reproduction|reproduction]] most amphibians require [[fresh water]] although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist.

They reproduce via direct development, an ecological and evolutionary adaptation that has allowed them to be completely independent from free-standing water. Almost all of these frogs live in wet [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforests]] and their eggs hatch directly into miniature versions of the adult, passing through the [[tadpole]] stage within the egg. Reproductive success of many amphibians is dependent not only on the quantity of rainfall, but the seasonal timing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461 |title=Abiotic factor |author=Hogan, C.

In temperate regions, breeding is mostly seasonal, usually in the spring, and is triggered by increasing day length, rising temperatures or rainfall. Experiments have shown the importance of temperature, but the trigger event, especially in arid regions, is often a storm. In anurans, males usually arrive at the breeding sites before females and the vocal chorus they produce may stimulate ovulation in females and the endocrine activity of males that are not yet reproductively active.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=140\u2013141 }}\n\nIn caecilians, fertilisation is internal, the male extruding an [[intromittent organ]], the phallodeum, and inserting it into the female cloaca. The paired M\u00fcllerian glands inside the male cloaca secrete a fluid which resembles that produced by mammalian [[prostate]] glands and which may transport and nourish the sperm. Fertilisation probably takes place in the oviduct.<ref name=\"Duellman\">{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman|first=Willia E. |author2= Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=77\u201379 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&pg=PA77&lpg=PA77&dq=phallodeum#v=onepage&q=phallodeum&f=false }}</ref>\n\nThe majority of salamanders also engage in internal fertilisation. In most of these, the male deposits a spermatophore, a small packet of sperm on top of a gelatinous cone, on the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]] either on land or in the water. The female takes up the sperm packet by grasping it with the lips of the cloaca and pushing it into the vent. The spermatozoa move to the spermatheca in the roof of the cloaca where they remain until ovulation which may be many months later. Courtship rituals and methods of transfer of the spermatophore vary between species. In some, the spermatophore may be placed directly into the female cloaca while in others, the female may be guided to the spermatophore or restrained with an embrace called [[amplexus]]. Certain primitive salamanders in the families Sirenidae, [[Hynobiidae]] and [[Cryptobranchidae]] practice external fertilisation in a similar manner to frogs, with the female laying the eggs in water and the male releasing sperm onto the egg mass.<ref name=\"Duellman\" />\n\nWith a few exceptions, frogs use external fertilisation. The male grasps the female tightly with his forelimbs either behind the arms or in front of the back legs, or in the case of ''[[Epipedobates tricolor]]'', around the neck. They remain in amplexus with their cloacae positioned close together while the female lays the eggs and the male covers them with sperm. Roughened nuptial pads on the male's hands aid in retaining grip. Often the male collects and retains the egg mass, forming a sort of basket with the hind feet. An exception is the [[granular poison frog]] (''Oophaga granulifera'') where the male and female place their cloacae in close proximity while facing in opposite directions and then release eggs and sperm simultaneously. The [[tailed frog]] (''Ascaphus truei'') exhibits internal fertilisation. The \"tail\" is only possessed by the male and is an extension of the cloaca and used to inseminate the female. This frog lives in fast-flowing streams and internal fertilisation prevents the sperm from being washed away before fertilisation occurs.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154\u2013162 }} The sperm may be retained in storage tubes attached to the [[oviduct]] until the following spring.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amphibiaweb.org/cgi/amphib_query?where-genus=Ascaphus&where-species=truei |title=''Ascaphus truei'' |author1=Adams, Michael J. |author2=Pearl, Christopher A. |year=2005 |publisher=AmphibiaWeb |accessdate=November 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nMost frogs can be classified as either prolonged or explosive breeders. Typically, prolonged breeders congregate at a breeding site, the males usually arriving first, calling and setting up territories. Other satellite males remain quietly nearby, waiting for their opportunity to take over a territory. The females arrive sporadically, mate selection takes place and eggs are laid. The females depart and territories may change hands. More females appear and in due course, the breeding season comes to an end. Explosive breeders on the other hand are found where temporary pools appear in dry regions after rainfall. These frogs are typically [[wikt:fossorial|fossorial]] species that emerge after heavy rains and congregate at a breeding site. They are attracted there by the calling of the first male to find a suitable place, perhaps a pool that forms in the same place each rainy season. The assembled frogs may call in unison and frenzied activity ensues, the males scrambling to mate with the usually smaller number of females.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | pp=154\u2013162 }}\n\n[[File:Plethodon cinereus.jpg|right|thumb|240px|Sexual selection has been studied in the [[red back salamander]]]]\n<!--[[Sexual selection]] typically manifests as male-male competition where males will arrive at the waters edge first in large number, producing a wide range of vocalizations and other complex behaviours to attract mates, with the [[fitness (biology)|fittest]] males having the deepest croaks and the best territories.

In typical amphibian development, eggs are laid in water and larvae are adapted to an aquatic lifestyle. Frogs, toads and salamanders all hatch from the egg as larvae with external gills. Metamorphosis in amphibians is regulated by [[thyroxine]] concentration in the blood, which stimulates metamorphosis, and [[prolactin]], which counteracts thyroxine's effect. Specific events are dependent on threshold values for different tissues.<ref>{{Cite book| last1 = Kikuyama | first1 = Sakae\n | last2 = Kawamura | first2 = Kousuke\n | last3 = Tanaka | first3 = Shigeyasu\n | last4 = Yamamoto | first4 = Kakutoshi\n | title = International Review of Cytology: A Survey of Cell Biology\n | chapter = Aspects of amphibian metamorphosis: Hormonal control\n | publisher = Academic Press\n | pages = 105\u2013126\n | year = 1993\n | url = https://books.google.com/?id=wfSM70CuYqYC&pg=PA105&dq=amphibian+metamorphosis#v=onepage&q=amphibian%20metamorphosis&f=false\n | isbn = 978-0-12-364548-7\n }}</ref> Because most embryonic development is outside the parental body, it is subject to many adaptations due to specific environmental circumstances.

This capsule is permeable to water and gases, and swells considerably as it absorbs water. The ovum is at first rigidly held, but in fertilised eggs the innermost layer liquefies and allows the [[embryo]] to move freely. This also happens in salamander eggs, even when they are unfertilised. Eggs of some salamanders and frogs contain unicellular green algae. These penetrate the jelly envelope after the eggs are laid and may increase the supply of oxygen to the embryo through photosynthesis.

The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures on either side of the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera ''[[Ambystoma]]'' and ''[[Dicamptodon]]'' have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The [[northwestern salamander]] (''Ambystoma gracile'') is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as [[neoteny]], or transforms into an adult.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Valentine, Barry D. |author2=Dennis, David M. | year=1964 | title=A comparison of the gill-arch system and fins of three genera of larval salamanders, ''Rhyacotriton'', ''Gyrinophilus'', and ''Ambystoma'' | journal=Copeia | volume=1964 | issue=1 | pages=196\u2013201 | jstor=1440850 | doi=10.2307/1440850 }}</ref> Both of these are able to breed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amphibiaweb.org/cgi-bin/amphib_query?where-genus=Ambystoma&where-species=gracile |title=''Ambystoma gracile'' |author=Shaffer, H.

There are fifteen species of [[wikt:obligate|obligate]] neotenic salamanders, including species of ''[[Necturus]]'', ''[[Olm|Proteus]]'' and ''Amphiuma'', and many examples of [[wikt:facultative|facultative]] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.<ref>{{cite book |title=Biology of Amphibians |last=Duellman |first=William E. |author2=Trueb, Linda |year=1994 |publisher=JHU Press |isbn=978-0-8018-4780-6 |pages=191\u2013192 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=CzxVvKmrtIgC&pg=PA191&lpg=PA191&dq=salamander+obligate+neoteny#v=onepage&q=salamander%20obligate%20neoteny&f=false }}</ref>\n\nLungless salamanders in the family Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay a small number of unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus ''[[Ensatinas]]'', the female has been observed to coil around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.{{sfn | Stebbins | Cohen | 1995 | p=196 }}\n\nIn newts and salamanders, metamorphosis is less dramatic than in frogs. This is because the larvae are already carnivorous and continue to feed as predators when they are adults so few changes are needed to their digestive systems. Their lungs are functional early, but the larvae do not make as much use of them as do tadpoles. Their gills are never covered by gill sacs and are reabsorbed just before the animals leave the water. Other changes include the reduction in size or loss of tail fins, the closure of gill slits, thickening of the skin, the development of eyelids, and certain changes in dentition and tongue structure. Salamanders are at their most vulnerable at metamorphosis as swimming speeds are reduced and transforming tails are encumbrances on land.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Shaffer, H.

The development of the young of ''[[Ichthyophis glutinosus]]'', a species from Sri Lanka, has been much studied. The eel-like larvae hatch out of the eggs and make their way to water. They have three pairs of external red feathery gills, a blunt head with two rudimentary eyes, a lateral line system and a short tail with fins. They swim by undulating their body from side to side. They are mostly active at night, soon lose their gills and make sorties onto land. Metamorphosis is gradual. By the age of about ten months they have developed a pointed head with sensory tentacles near the mouth and lost their eyes, lateral line systems and tails. The skin thickens, embedded scales develop and the body divides into segments. By this time, the caecilian has constructed a burrow and is living on land.<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Breckenridge, W.

''[[Typhlonectes compressicauda]]'', a species from South America, is typical of these. Up to nine larvae can develop in the oviduct at any one time. They are elongated and have paired sac-like gills, small eyes and specialised scraping teeth. At first, they feed on the yolks of the eggs, but as this source of nourishment declines they begin to rasp at the ciliated epithelial cells that line the oviduct. This stimulates the secretion of fluids rich in [[lipid]]s and mucoproteins on which they feed along with scrapings from the oviduct wall. They may increase their length sixfold and be two-fifths as long as their mother before being born. By this time they have undergone metamorphosis, lost their eyes and gills, developed a thicker skin and mouth tentacles, and reabsorbed their teeth.

These are usually feeding, breeding or sheltering sites. Males normally exhibit such behaviour though in some species, females and even juveniles are also involved. Although in many frog species, females are larger than males, this is not the case in most species where males are actively involved in territorial defence. Some of these have specific adaptations such as enlarged teeth for biting or spines on the chest, arms or thumbs.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Shine, Richard |year=1979 |title=Sexual selection and sexual dimorphism in the Amphibia |journal=Copeia |volume=1979 |issue=2 |pages=297\u2013306 |jstor=1443418 |doi=10.2307/1443418 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Redback salamander.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Red-backed salamander|The red back salamander (''[[Plethodon cinereus]]'') defends a territory against intruders.]]\nIn salamanders, defence of a territory involves adopting an aggressive posture and if necessary attacking the intruder. This may involve snapping, chasing and sometimes biting, occasionally causing the loss of a tail.

Much of their behaviour seemed stereotyped and did not involve any actual contact between individuals. An aggressive posture involved raising the body off the ground and glaring at the opponent who often turned away submissively. If the intruder persisted, a biting lunge was usually launched at either the tail region or the naso-labial grooves. Damage to either of these areas can reduce the fitness of the rival, either because of the need to regenerate tissue or because it impairs its ability to detect food.<ref name=\"Gergits\" />\n\nIn frogs, male territorial behaviour is often observed at breeding locations; calling is both an announcement of ownership of part of this resource and an advertisement call to potential mates. In general, a deeper voice represents a heavier and more powerful individual, and this may be sufficient to prevent intrusion by smaller males. Much energy is used in the vocalization and it takes a toll on the territory holder who may be displaced by a fitter rival if he tires. There is a tendency for males to tolerate the holders of neighbouring territories while vigorously attacking unknown intruders. Holders of territories have a \"home advantage\" and usually come off better in an encounter between two similar-sized frogs. If threats are insufficient, chest to chest tussles may take place. Fighting methods include pushing and shoving, deflating the opponent's vocal sac, seizing him by the head, jumping on his back, biting, chasing, splashing, and ducking him under the water.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Wells, K.

In addition, it is the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population|3rd least populous]] and the [[List of U.S. states and territories by population density|most sparsely populated]] of the [[List of U.S. states|50 United States]]; nevertheless, it is by far the most populous territory located mostly north of the [[60th parallel north|60th parallel]] in North America, its population (the total estimated at 738,432 by the U.S. Census Bureau in 2015<ref name=PopEstUS/>) more than quadrupling the combined populations of [[Northern Canada]] and [[Greenland]]. Approximately half of Alaska's residents live within the [[Anchorage metropolitan area]].

Alaska is the only non-[[contiguous]] U.S. state on continental North America; about {{convert|500|mi|km|-1}} of [[British Columbia]] (Canada) separates Alaska from [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. It is technically part of the [[Continental United States|continental U.S.]], but is sometimes not included in colloquial use; Alaska is not part of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous U.S.]], often called [[Outside (Alaska)|\"the Lower 48\"]]. The capital city, [[Juneau]], is situated on the mainland of the North American continent but is not connected by road to the rest of the North American highway system.\n\nThe state is bordered by [[Yukon]] and [[British Columbia]] in Canada, to the east, the [[Gulf of Alaska]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the south and southwest, the [[Bering Sea]], [[Bering Strait]], and [[Chukchi Sea]] to the west and the [[Arctic Ocean]] to the north. Alaska's territorial waters touch Russia's territorial waters in the Bering Strait, as the Russian [[Big Diomede Island]] and Alaskan [[Little Diomede Island]] are only {{convert|3|mi|km}} apart.

Smaller portions are set aside for rural subdivisions and other homesteading-related opportunities. These are not very popular due to the often remote and roadless locations. The [[University of Alaska]], as a [[land grant university]], also owns substantial acreage which it manages independently.\n\nAnother {{convert|44|e6acre|e6ha|abbr=off}} are owned by 12 regional, and scores of local, Native corporations created under the [[Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act]] (ANCSA) of 1971. [[Alaska Native Regional Corporation|Regional Native corporation]] [[Doyon, Limited]] often promotes itself as the largest private landowner in Alaska in advertisements and other communications. Provisions of ANCSA allowing the corporations' land holdings to be sold on the open market starting in 1991 were repealed before they could take effect. Effectively, the corporations hold title (including subsurface title in many cases, a privilege denied to individual Alaskans) but cannot sell the land. [[Alaska Native Allotment Act|Individual Native allotments]] can be and are sold on the open market, however.\n\nVarious private interests own the remaining land, totaling about one percent of the state. Alaska is, by a large margin, the state with the smallest percentage of private land ownership when Native corporation holdings are excluded.\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main article|Climate of Alaska}}\n[[File:AK_koppen.svg|300px|thumb|[[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen climate types]] of Alaska.]]\n[[File:Alaska climate regions USGS.gif|thumb|Map depicting the climate zones of Alaska.]]\n\nThe climate in Southeast Alaska is a mid-latitude [[oceanic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]: ''Cfb'') in the southern sections and a subarctic oceanic climate (K\u00f6ppen ''Cfc'') in the northern parts. On an annual basis, Southeast is both the wettest and warmest part of Alaska with milder temperatures in the winter and high precipitation throughout the year.

While the area gets less rain than southeast Alaska, it gets more snow, and days tend to be clearer. On average, [[Anchorage, Alaska|Anchorage]] receives {{convert|16|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation a year, with around {{convert|75|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow, although there are areas in the south central which receive far more snow.

It is a subarctic oceanic climate in the southwest and a continental subarctic climate farther north. The temperature is somewhat moderate considering how far north the area is. This [[region]] has a tremendous amount of variety in precipitation. An area stretching from the northern side of the Seward Peninsula to the [[Kobuk River]] valley (i.&nbsp;e., the region around [[Kotzebue Sound]]) is technically a [[desert]], with portions receiving less than {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} of precipitation annually.

After his crew returned to Russia with [[sea otter]] pelts judged to be the finest fur in the world, small associations of fur traders began to sail from the shores of Siberia toward the Aleutian Islands. The first permanent European settlement was founded in 1784.\n[[File:Russian Sloop-of-War Neva.jpg|thumb|left|The Russian settlement of St. Paul's Harbor (present-day [[Kodiak, Alaska|Kodiak town]]), [[Kodiak Island]], 1814.]]\n\nBetween 1774 and 1800, [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|Spain]] sent several [[Spanish expeditions to the Pacific Northwest|expeditions to Alaska]] in order to assert its claim over the Pacific Northwest. In 1789 a Spanish settlement and [[Fort San Miguel|fort]] were built in [[Nootka Sound]]. These expeditions gave names to places such as [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]], [[Bucareli Sound]], and [[Cordova, Alaska|Cordova]]. Later, the [[Russian-American Company]] carried out an expanded colonization program during the early-to-mid-19th century.\n\n[[Sitka, Alaska|Sitka]], renamed [[New Archangel]] from 1804 to 1867, on [[Baranof Island]] in the [[Alexander Archipelago]] in what is now [[Southeast Alaska]], became the capital of [[Russian America]]. It remained the capital after the colony was transferred to the United States. The Russians never fully colonized Alaska, and the colony was never very profitable. Evidence of Russian settlement in names and churches survive throughout southeast Alaska.\n\n[[William H. Seward]], the [[United States Secretary of State]], negotiated the [[Alaska Purchase]] (also known as Seward's Folly) with the Russians in 1867 for $7.2&nbsp;million. Alaska was loosely governed by the military initially, and was administered as a [[District of Alaska|district]] starting in 1884, with a governor appointed by the [[President of the United States]].

The construction of military bases contributed to the population growth of some Alaskan cities.\n\n===Statehood===\n{{see also|Alaska Statehood Act}}\nStatehood for Alaska was an important cause of [[James Wickersham]] early in his tenure as a congressional delegate. Decades later, the statehood movement gained its first real momentum following a territorial referendum in 1946. The Alaska Statehood Committee and Alaska's Constitutional Convention would soon follow. Statehood supporters also found themselves fighting major battles against political foes, mostly in the U.S. Congress but also within Alaska. Statehood was approved by Congress on July 7, 1958. Alaska was officially proclaimed a state on January 3, 1959.\n\nIn 1960, the Census Bureau reported Alaska's population as 77.2% White, 3% Black, and 18.8% American Indian and Alaska Native.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alaska \u2013 Race and Hispanic Origin: 1880 to 1990 |publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |url=http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |accessdate=April 18, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224151538/http://www.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/twps0056.html |archivedate=December 24, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n[[File:1964 Alaska Quake Kodiak Before and After.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kodiak, before and after the [[tsunami]] which followed the [[Good Friday]] earthquake in 1964, destroying much of the townsite.]]\n\n===Good Friday earthquake===\n{{Main Article|1964 Alaska earthquake}}\nOn March 27, 1964, the massive [[1964 Alaska earthquake|Good Friday earthquake]] killed 133 people and destroyed several villages and portions of large coastal communities, mainly by the resultant [[tsunamis]] and landslides.

Royalty revenues from oil have funded large state budgets from 1980 onward. That same year, not coincidentally, Alaska repealed its state income tax.\n\nIn 1989, the ''[[Exxon Valdez]]'' hit a reef in the [[Prince William Sound]], spilling over {{convert|11|MUSgal|Ml|lk=out|abbr=off|sp=us}} of crude oil over {{convert|1100|mi}} of coastline.

Alaska's main export product (excluding oil and natural gas) is seafood, primarily salmon, cod, Pollock and crab.\n\nAgriculture represents a very small fraction of the Alaskan economy. Agricultural production is primarily for consumption within the state and includes nursery stock, dairy products, vegetables, and livestock. Manufacturing is limited, with most foodstuffs and general goods imported from elsewhere.\n\nEmployment is primarily in government and industries such as natural resource extraction, shipping, and transportation. Military bases are a significant component of the economy in the Fairbanks North Star, Anchorage and Kodiak Island boroughs, as well as Kodiak. Federal subsidies are also an important part of the economy, allowing the state to keep taxes low. Its industrial outputs are crude petroleum, natural gas, coal, gold, precious metals, zinc and other mining, seafood processing, timber and wood products. There is also a growing service and tourism sector.

Though wind and hydroelectric power are abundant and underdeveloped, proposals for statewide energy systems (e.g. with special [[single-wire earth return#Use in interties|low-cost electric interties]]) were judged uneconomical (at the time of the report, 2001) due to low (less than 50\u00a2/gal) fuel prices, long distances and low population.<ref>{{cite web|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216014031/http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |archivedate=February 16, 2008 |url=http://www.dced.state.ak.us/dca/AEIS/PDF_Files/AIDEA_Energy_Screening.pdf |title=Screening Report for Alaska Rural Energy Plan |date=April 2001 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> The cost of a gallon of gas in urban Alaska today is usually 30\u201360\u00a2 higher than the national average; prices in rural areas are generally significantly higher but vary widely depending on transportation costs, seasonal usage peaks, nearby petroleum development infrastructure and many other factors.\n\n====Permanent Fund====\nThe [[Alaska Permanent Fund]] is a constitutionally authorized appropriation of oil revenues, established by voters in 1976 to manage a surplus in state petroleum revenues from oil, largely in anticipation of the then recently constructed [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]]. The fund was originally proposed by Governor [[Keith Harvey Miller|Keith Miller]] on the eve of the 1969 Prudhoe Bay lease sale, out of fear that the legislature would spend the entire proceeds of the sale (which amounted to $900 million) at once. It was later championed by Governor [[Jay Hammond]] and [[Kenai, Alaska|Kenai]] [[Alaska House of Representatives|state representative]] Hugh Malone. It has served as an attractive political prospect ever since, diverting revenues which would normally be deposited into the general fund.\n\nThe [[Alaska Constitution]] was written so as to discourage dedicating state funds for a particular purpose. The Permanent Fund has become the rare exception to this, mostly due to the political climate of distrust existing during the time of its creation. From its initial principal of $734,000, the fund has grown to $50&nbsp;billion as a result of oil royalties and capital investment programs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.apfc.org/|title=Alaska Permanent Fund Corporation|work=apfc.org}}</ref> Most if not all the principal is invested conservatively outside Alaska. This has led to frequent calls by Alaskan politicians for the Fund to make investments within Alaska, though such a stance has never gained momentum.\n\nStarting in 1982, dividends from the fund's annual growth have been paid out each year to eligible Alaskans, ranging from an initial $1,000 in 1982 (equal to three years' payout, as the distribution of payments was held up in a lawsuit over the distribution scheme) to $3,269 in 2008 (which included a one-time $1,200 \"Resource Rebate\"). Every year, the state legislature takes out 8% from the earnings, puts 3% back into the principal for inflation proofing, and the remaining 5% is distributed to all qualifying Alaskans. To qualify for the Permanent Fund Dividend, one must have lived in the state for a minimum of 12 months, maintain constant residency subject to allowable absences,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |title=State of Alaska Permanent Fund Division |publisher=Pfd.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420014117/http://www.pfd.state.ak.us/dividendamounts/index.aspx |archivedate=April 20, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> and not be subject to court judgments or criminal convictions which fall under various disqualifying classifications or may subject the payment amount to civil garnishment.\n\nThe Permanent Fund is often considered to be one of the leading examples of a \"[[Basic income|Basic Income]]\" policy in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title = Alaska's Citizens' Dividend Set To Be Near Highest Ever|url = http://www.basicincome.org/news/2015/08/alaska-usa-dividend-amount-estimated-to-be-near-highest-ever/|website = BIEN|accessdate = 2015-11-03}}</ref>\n\n===Cost of living===\nThe cost of goods in Alaska has long been higher than in the contiguous 48 states. Federal government employees, particularly [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers and active-duty military members, receive a Cost of Living Allowance usually set at 25% of base pay because, while the cost of living has gone down, it is still one of the highest in the country.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\nRural Alaska suffers from extremely high prices for food and consumer goods compared to the rest of the country, due to the relatively limited transportation infrastructure.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n===Agriculture and fishing===\n[[File:Pacific Halibut Fileting.JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Halibut]] is important to the state's economy as both a commercial and sport-caught fish.]]\n\nDue to the northern climate and short growing season, relatively little farming occurs in Alaska. Most farms are in either the [[Matanuska Valley]], about {{convert|40|mi|km}} northeast of [[Anchorage]], or on the [[Kenai Peninsula]], about {{convert|60|mi|km}} southwest of Anchorage. The short 100-day growing season limits the crops that can be grown, but the long sunny summer days make for productive growing seasons. The primary crops are potatoes, carrots, lettuce, and cabbage.\n\nThe [[Tanana Valley]] is another notable agricultural locus, especially the [[Delta Junction, Alaska|Delta Junction]] area, about {{convert|100|mi|km}} southeast of Fairbanks, with a sizable concentration of farms growing agronomic crops; these farms mostly lie north and east of [[Fort Greely]]. This area was largely set aside and developed under a state program spearheaded by Hammond during his second term as governor. Delta-area crops consist predominately of barley and hay. West of Fairbanks lies another concentration of small farms catering to restaurants, the hotel and tourist industry, and [[community-supported agriculture]].\n\nAlaskan agriculture has experienced a surge in growth of [[market gardener]]s, small farms and [[farmers' market]]s in recent years, with the highest percentage increase (46%) in the nation in growth in farmers' markets in 2011, compared to 17% nationwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usda.gov/wps/portal/usda/usdamediafb?contentid=2011/08/0338.xml&printable=true&contentidonly=true |title=More than 1,000 New Farmers Markets Recorded Across Country as USDA Directory Reveals 17 Percent Growth &#124; USDA Newsroom |publisher=Usda.gov |date= August 5, 2011|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref> The [[peony]] industry has also taken off, as the growing season allows farmers to harvest during a gap in supply elsewhere in the world, thereby filling a niche in the flower market.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://alaskapeonies.org/ |title=Welcome to The Alaska Peony Growers Association |publisher=Alaskapeonies.org|accessdate=June 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{double image|left|Heavy-lift_melon.jpg|190|Monster vegetable display at the Tanana Valley State Fair 2010.jpg|200|Oversized vegetables on display at the [[Alaska State Fair]] (left) and the [[Tanana Valley State Fair]] (right).}}\nAlaska, with no counties, lacks county fairs. However, a small assortment of state and local fairs (with the [[Alaska State Fair]] in [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] the largest), are held mostly in the late summer. The fairs are mostly located in communities with historic or current agricultural activity, and feature local farmers exhibiting produce in addition to more high-profile commercial activities such as carnival rides, concerts and food. \"Alaska Grown\" is used as an agricultural slogan.\n\nAlaska has an abundance of seafood, with the primary fisheries in the Bering Sea and the North Pacific. Seafood is one of the few food items that is often cheaper within the state than outside it. Many Alaskans take advantage of salmon seasons to harvest portions of their household diet while fishing for subsistence, as well as sport. This includes fish taken by hook, net or wheel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |title=Alaska Department of Fish and Game |publisher=Adfg.alaska.gov |accessdate=May 29, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110624202032/http://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=fishingPersonalUse.main |archivedate=June 24, 2011 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nHunting for subsistence, primarily [[caribou]], [[moose]], and [[Dall sheep]] is still common in the state, particularly in remote [[The Bush (Alaska)|Bush]] communities. An example of a traditional native food is [[Akutaq]], the Eskimo ice cream, which can consist of reindeer fat, seal oil, dried fish meat and local berries.\n\nAlaska's reindeer herding is concentrated on [[Seward Peninsula]], where wild caribou can be prevented from mingling and migrating with the domesticated reindeer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu/about_reindeer/seward_peninsula.php |title=Reindeer Herding |publisher=Reindeer.salrm.uaf.edu |accessdate=November 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\nMost food in Alaska is transported into the state from [[Outside (Alaska)|\"Outside\"]], and shipping costs make food in the cities relatively expensive. In rural areas, subsistence hunting and gathering is an essential activity because imported food is prohibitively expensive. Though most small towns and villages in Alaska lie along the coastline, the cost of importing food to remote villages can be high, because of the terrain and difficult road conditions, which change dramatically, due to varying climate and precipitation changes. The cost of transport can reach as high as 50\u00a2 per pound ($1.10/kg) or more in some remote areas, during the most difficult times, if these locations can be reached at all during such inclement weather and terrain conditions. The cost of delivering a {{convert|1|USgal|L}} of milk is about $3.50 in many villages where per capita income can be $20,000 or less. Fuel cost per gallon is routinely 20\u201330\u00a2 higher than the continental United States average, with only Hawaii having higher prices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Daily Fuel Gauge Report|url=http://fuelgaugereport.aaa.com/?redirectto=http://fuelgaugereport.opisnet.com/index.asp|publisher=Automobile Association of America|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Retail Fuel Pricing and News|url=http://www.opisnet.com/retail-fuel-prices.aspx|publisher=Oil Price Information Service|accessdate=May 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Sterling Highway.jpg|thumb|The [[Sterling Highway]], near its intersection with the [[Seward Highway]].]]\n{{Main article|Transportation in Alaska}}\n\n===Roads===\n{{See also|List of Alaska Routes}}\n[[File:Susitnabridge.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Susitna River]] bridge on the [[Denali Highway]] is {{convert|1036|ft}} long.]]\n[[File:Interstate Alaska map.png|thumb|[[Interstate Highways in Alaska|Alaska Interstate Highways]].]]\n\nAlaska has few road connections compared to the rest of the U.S. The state's road system covers a relatively small area of the state, linking the central population centers and the [[Alaska Highway]], the principal route out of the state through Canada. The state capital, Juneau, is not accessible by road, only a car ferry, which has spurred several debates over the decades about moving the capital to a city on the road system, or building a road connection from [[Haines, Alaska|Haines]]. The western part of Alaska has no road system connecting the communities with the rest of Alaska.\n\nOne unique feature of the Alaska Highway system is the [[Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel]], an active [[Alaska Railroad]] tunnel recently upgraded to provide a paved roadway link with the isolated community of [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] on [[Prince William Sound]] to the [[Seward Highway]] about {{convert|50|mi|km}} southeast of Anchorage at [[Portage, Alaska|Portage]]. At {{convert|2.5|mi|km|1}}, the tunnel was the longest road tunnel in North America until 2007.<ref>completion of the {{convert|3.5|mi|km|adj=on|1}} [[Interstate 93]] tunnel as part of the \"[[Big Dig]]\" project in Boston, Massachusetts.</ref> The tunnel is the longest combination [[List of road-rail tunnels|road and rail tunnel]] in North America.\n\n===Rail===\n[[File:Alaska Railroad.jpg|thumb|An Alaska Railroad locomotive and tanker cars crossing the [[George Parks Highway]] in 1994.]]\n[[File:Skagway-Hoonah-Angoon Census Area, In to the Tunnel.jpg|thumb|The [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] traverses rugged terrain north of [[Skagway]] near the [[Canada\u2013United States border|Canada\u2013US border]].]]\n\nBuilt around 1915, the [[Alaska Railroad]] (ARR) played a key role in the development of Alaska through the 20th century. It links north Pacific shipping through providing critical infrastructure with tracks that run from [[Seward, Alaska|Seward]] to [[Interior Alaska]] by way of [[South Central Alaska]], passing through Anchorage, [[Eklutna]], Wasilla, [[Talkeetna, Alaska|Talkeetna]], [[Denali]], and Fairbanks, with spurs to [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]], [[Palmer, Alaska|Palmer]] and [[North Pole, Alaska|North Pole]]. The cities, towns, villages, and region served by ARR tracks are known statewide as \"The Railbelt\". In recent years, the ever-improving paved highway system began to eclipse the railroad's importance in Alaska's economy.\n\nThe railroad played a vital role in Alaska's development, moving freight into Alaska while transporting natural resources southward (i.e., coal from the Usibelli coal mine near [[Healy, Alaska|Healy]] to Seward and gravel from the Matanuska Valley to Anchorage). It is well known for its summertime tour passenger service.\n\nThe Alaska Railroad was one of the last railroads in North America to use [[caboose]]s in regular service and still uses them on some gravel trains. It continues to offer one of the last [[Request stop|flag stop]] routes in the country. A stretch of about {{convert|60|mi|km|-1}} of track along an area north of Talkeetna remains inaccessible by road; the railroad provides the only transportation to rural homes and cabins in the area. Until construction of the Parks Highway in the 1970s, the railroad provided the only land access to most of the region along its entire route.\n\nIn northern Southeast Alaska, the [[White Pass and Yukon Route]] also partly runs through the state from [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]] northwards into Canada (British Columbia and Yukon Territory), crossing the border at [[White Pass]] Summit. This line is now mainly used by tourists, often arriving by cruise liner at Skagway. It was featured in the 1983 [[BBC]] television series ''[[Great Little Railways]].''\n\nThe Alaska Rail network is not connected to Outside. In 2000, the U.S. Congress authorized $6&nbsp;million to study the feasibility of a rail link between Alaska, Canada, and the lower 48.<ref name=\"RailLink1\">{{cite web|url=http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |title=Alaska Oil / BC Tar sands via rail |author=Barbara Yaffe |date=January 2, 2011 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101219014658/http://communities.canada.com/vancouversun/blogs/powerplay/archive/2010/12/13/transporting-oil-across-b-c.aspx |archivedate=December 19, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"RailLink2\">{{cite news | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2138860820070622| title= Economic study touts Alaska-Canada rail link| author=Allan Dowd   | date=June 27, 2007 | accessdate=January 2, 2011 |agency=Reuters  }}</ref><ref name=\"RailLink3\">{{cite web|url=http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |title=Alaska Canada Rail Link |author=AlaskaCanadaRail.org |date=January 2, 2005 |accessdate=January 2, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425025223/http://alaskacanadarail.com/index.html |archivedate=April 25, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n[[Alaska Rail Marine]] provides [[car float]] service between [[Whittier, Alaska|Whittier]] and [[Seattle]].\n\n===Marine transport===\nMany cities, towns and villages in the state do not have road or highway access; the only modes of access involve travel by air, river, or the sea.\n\n[[File:Tustumena, Alaska Marine Highway.jpg|thumb|The {{MV|Tustumena}} (named after [[Tustumena Glacier]]) is one of the state's many ferries, providing service between the [[Kenai Peninsula]], [[Kodiak Island]] and the [[Aleutian Chain]].]]\n\nAlaska's well-developed state-owned ferry system (known as the [[Alaska Marine Highway]]) serves the cities of [[Southeast Alaska|southeast]], the Gulf Coast and the Alaska Peninsula.

The system also operates a ferry service from [[Bellingham, Washington]] and [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] in Canada through the [[Inside Passage]] to [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]]. The [[Inter-Island Ferry Authority]] also serves as an important marine link for many communities in the [[Prince of Wales Island (Alaska)|Prince of Wales Island]] region of Southeast and works in concert with the Alaska Marine Highway.\n\nIn recent years, cruise lines have created a summertime tourism market, mainly connecting the Pacific Northwest to Southeast Alaska and, to a lesser degree, towns along Alaska's gulf coast.

The smallest towns and villages must rely on scheduled or chartered bush flying services using general aviation aircraft such as the [[Cessna Caravan]], the most popular aircraft in use in the state. Much of this service can be attributed to the Alaska bypass mail program which subsidizes bulk mail delivery to Alaskan rural communities. The program requires 70% of that subsidy to go to carriers who offer passenger service to the communities.\n\nMany communities have small air taxi services. These operations originated from the demand for customized transport to remote areas. Perhaps the most quintessentially Alaskan plane is the bush seaplane. The world's busiest seaplane base is [[Lake Hood Seaplane Base|Lake Hood]], located next to Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport, where flights bound for remote villages without an airstrip carry passengers, cargo, and many items from stores and warehouse clubs.

Other local taxes levied include raw fish taxes, hotel, motel, and bed-and-breakfast 'bed' taxes, [[severance tax]]es, liquor and tobacco taxes, gaming (pull tabs) taxes, tire taxes and fuel transfer taxes. A part of the revenue collected from certain state taxes and license fees (such as petroleum, aviation motor fuel, telephone cooperative) is shared with municipalities in Alaska.\n\n[[Fairbanks, Alaska|Fairbanks]] has one of the highest property taxes in the state as no sales or income taxes are assessed in the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (FNSB). A sales tax for the FNSB has been voted on many times, but has yet to be approved, leading lawmakers to increase taxes dramatically on goods such as liquor and tobacco.\n\nIn 2014 the [[Tax Foundation]] ranked Alaska as having the fourth most \"business friendly\" tax policy, behind only [[Wyoming]], [[South Dakota]], and [[Nevada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/how-friendly-your-states-tax-system-tax-foundations-2014-state-business-tax-climate-index |title=How Friendly Is Your State's Tax System?

Republicans have won the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral college]] votes in all but one election that it has participated in ([[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]]). No state has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate fewer times. Alaska was carried by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] during his landslide election in [[U.S. presidential election, 1964|1964]], while the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1968|1968]] elections were close. Since [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972]], however, Republicans have carried the state by large margins. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008]], Republican [[John McCain]] defeated Democrat [[Barack Obama]] in Alaska, 59.49% to 37.83%. McCain's running mate was [[Sarah Palin]], the state's governor and the first Alaskan on a major party ticket. Obama lost Alaska again in [[U.S. presidential election, 2012|2012]], but he captured 40% of the state's vote in that election, making him the first Democrat to do so since 1968.\n\nThe [[The Bush (Alaska)|Alaska Bush]], central Juneau, midtown and downtown Anchorage, and the areas surrounding the [[University of Alaska Fairbanks]] campus and Ester have been strongholds of the Democratic Party. The Matanuska-Susitna Borough, the majority of Fairbanks (including North Pole and the military base), and South Anchorage typically have the strongest Republican showing. {{as of|2004}}, well over half of all registered voters have chosen \"Non-Partisan\" or \"Undeclared\" as their affiliation,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225223222/http://www.gov.state.ak.us/ltgov/elections/regbypty.htm |archivedate=February 25, 2008 |title=State of Alaska |publisher=Gov.state.ak.us |accessdate=June 2, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref> despite recent attempts to close primaries to unaffiliated voters.\n\nBecause of its population relative to other U.S. states, Alaska has only one member in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]].

The study of agriculture is known as [[agricultural science]]. The [[history of agriculture]] dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different [[climate]]s, [[culture]]s, and technologies. [[Industrial agriculture]] based on large-scale [[monoculture]] farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.\n\nModern [[agronomy]], [[plant breeding]], [[agrochemical]]s such as [[pesticide]]s and [[fertilizer]]s, and technological developments have in many cases sharply increased yields from cultivation, but at the same time have caused widespread ecological damage and negative human health effects. [[Selective breeding]] and modern practices in [[animal husbandry]] have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about [[animal welfare]] and the health effects of the [[antibiotics]], [[growth hormone]]s, and other chemicals commonly used in [[industrial meat production]]. [[Genetically modified organism]]s are an increasing component of agriculture, although they are banned in several countries. Agricultural food production and water management are increasingly becoming global issues that are fostering debate on a number of fronts. Significant degradation of land and water resources, including the depletion of [[aquifer]]s, has been observed in recent decades, and the effects of global warming on agriculture and of agriculture on global warming are still not fully understood.\n\nThe major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, [[fuel]]s, and [[raw material]]s. Specific foods include [[cereal]]s (grains), [[vegetable]]s, [[fruit]]s, [[cooking oil|oils]], [[meat]]s and [[spice]]s. Fibers include [[cotton]], [[wool]], [[hemp]], [[silk]] and [[flax]]. Raw materials include [[lumber]] and [[bamboo]]. Other useful materials are also produced by plants, such as [[resin]]s, [[natural dye|dyes]], [[drug]]s, [[perfume]]s, [[biofuel]]s and ornamental products such as [[Floriculture|cut flowers]] and [[nursery (horticulture)|nursery plants]]. Over one third of the world's workers are employed in agriculture, second only to the service sector, although the percentages of agricultural workers in developed countries has decreased significantly over the past several centuries.\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n\nThe word ''agriculture'' is a late [[Middle English]] adaptation of Latin ''agricult\u016bra'', from ''ager'', \"field\", and ''cult\u016bra'', \"[[Tillage|cultivation]]\" or \"growing\".<ref>{{cite book|page=14|title=The Oxford Dictionary of Word Histories|editor=Chantrell, Glynnis|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=0-19-863121-9}}</ref> Agriculture usually refers to human activities, although it is also observed in certain species of [[ant]], [[termite]] and [[ambrosia beetle]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |title=The Evolution of Agriculture in Insects |journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics |volume=36 |pages=563\u201395|date=December 2005 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.36.102003.152626 |author1=Ulrich G.

Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist [[Gregor Mendel]]. His work on [[dominant allele|dominant]] and [[recessive allele]]s, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, [[self-pollination]] and [[cross-pollination]], and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cls.casa.colostate.edu/TransgenicCrops/history.html |title=History of Plant Breeding|date=29 January 2004|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=11 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nDomestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and [[drought tolerance]], eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in [[New Zealand]]. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.<ref>{{cite journal|last= Stadler |first= L.

Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha.

The amount of emissions from the machinery increase with the attachment of different units and need for more power. During the soil preparation stage tillers and plows will be used to disrupt the soil. During growth watering pumps and sprayers are used to keep the crops hydrated.

He accepted immediately, and quickly married the Belgian refugee Maria Nys, also at Garsington.<ref>{{Citation | title = The Huxleys | first = Ronald W | last = Clark | publisher = William Heinemann | place = London | year = 1968}}.</ref> They lived with their young son in Italy part of the time during the 1920s, where Huxley would visit his friend [[D. H. Lawrence]]. Following Lawrence's death in 1930, Huxley edited Lawrence's letters (1932).<ref>{{Citation | first = George | last = Woodcock | year = 2007 | title = Dawn and the Darkest Hour: A Study of Aldous Huxley | page = 240 | publisher=Black Rose Books}}.</ref>\n\nWorks of this period included important novels on the dehumanising aspects of scientific progress, most famously ''[[Brave New World]]'', and on pacifist themes (for example, ''[[Eyeless in Gaza (novel)|Eyeless in Gaza]]''). In ''Brave New World'', set in a [[dystopia]]n London, Huxley portrays a society operating on the principles of mass production and [[Classical conditioning|Pavlovian conditioning]]. Huxley was strongly influenced by [[F. Matthias Alexander]] and included him as a character in ''Eyeless in Gaza''.\n\nStarting from this period, Huxley began to write and edit non-fiction works on pacifist issues, including ''[[Ends and Means]]'', ''An Encyclopedia of Pacifism'', and ''Pacifism and Philosophy'', and was an active member of the [[Peace Pledge Union]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |publisher=Peace Pledge Union |title=Aldous Huxley |accessdate=15 May 2011 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110606072731/http://www.ppu.org.uk/people/huxley.html |archivedate= 6 June 2011 |deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\n=== United States ===\nIn 1937, Huxley moved to Hollywood with his wife Maria, son [[Matthew Huxley]], and friend [[Gerald Heard]]. He lived in the US, mainly in southern California, until his death, but also for a time in [[Taos, New Mexico]], where he wrote ''[[Ends and Means]]'' (published in 1937). The book contains tracts on war, religion, nationalism and ethics.\n\nHeard introduced Huxley to [[Vedanta]] ([[Upanishads|Upanishad-centered philosophy]]), meditation, and [[vegetarianism]] through the principle of [[ahimsa]]. In 1938, Huxley befriended [[Jiddu Krishnamurti]], whose teachings he greatly admired. He also became a Vedantist in the circle of Hindu [[Swami Prabhavananda]], and introduced [[Christopher Isherwood]] to this circle. Not long after, Huxley wrote his book on widely held spiritual values and ideas, ''[[The Perennial Philosophy]]'', which discussed the teachings of renowned mystics of the world. Huxley's book affirmed a sensibility that insists there are realities beyond the generally accepted \"five senses\" and that there is genuine meaning for humans beyond both sensual satisfactions and sentimentalities.\n\nHuxley became a close friend of Remsen Bird, president of [[Occidental College]]. He spent much time at the college, which is in the [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles|Eagle Rock]] neighbourhood of Los Angeles. The college appears as \"Tarzana College\" in his satirical novel ''[[After Many a Summer]]'' (1939). The novel won Huxley a British literary award, the 1939 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for fiction.<ref>Haugrud Reiff, Raychel (2003) ''Aldous Huxley: Brave New World'' p. 103. Marshall Cavendish, 2009</ref> Huxley also incorporated Bird into the novel.\n\nDuring this period, Huxley earned a substantial income as a Hollywood screenwriter; [[Christopher Isherwood]], in his autobiography ''My Guru and His Disciple'', states that Huxley earned more than $3,000 per week (an enormous sum in those days) as a screenwriter, and that he used much of it to transport Jewish and left-wing writer and artist refugees from Hitler's Germany to the U.S. In March 1938, his friend [[Anita Loos]], a novelist and screenwriter, put him in touch with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] who hired Huxley for ''[[Madame Curie (film)|Madame Curie]]'', which was originally to star [[Greta Garbo]] and be directed by [[George Cukor]]. (Eventually, the film was completed by MGM in 1943 with a different director and cast.) Huxley received screen credit for ''[[Pride and Prejudice (1940 film)|Pride and Prejudice]]'' (1940) and was paid for his work on a number of other films, including ''[[Jane Eyre (1943 film)|Jane Eyre]]'' (1944). Huxley was commissioned by Walt Disney in 1945 to write a script based on ''Alice's Adventures in Wonderland'' and the biography of the story's author, Lewis Carroll. The script was not used, however.<ref>[http://www.salon.com/2010/04/15/mcsweeneys_intellectual_screenplays/ Salon]</ref>\n\nHuxley wrote an introduction to the posthumous publication of [[J. D. Unwin]]'s 1940 book ''Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society''.<ref>{{Citation | first = JD | last = Unwin | title = Hopousia or The Sexual and Economic Foundations of a New Society | year = 1940 | publisher = Oscar Piest | place = NY}}.</ref>\n\nOn 21 October 1949, Huxley wrote to [[George Orwell]], author of ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', congratulating him on \"how fine and how profoundly important the book is\". In his letter to Orwell, he predicted:\n{{Quote | Within the next generation I believe that the world's leaders will discover that infant conditioning and narco-hypnosis are more efficient, as instruments of government, than clubs and prisons, and that the lust for power can be just as completely satisfied by suggesting people into loving their servitude as by flogging them and kicking them into obedience.<ref name=\"Smith\">{{cite book |last = Huxley | first=Aldous |editor=Grover Smith |title=Letters of Aldous Huxley |year=1969 |publisher=Chatto & Windus |location=London |isbn = 978-0-7011-1312-4}}</ref>}}\n\nHuxley had deeply felt apprehensions about the future the developed world might make for itself. From these, he made some warnings in his writings and talks. In a 1958 televised interview conducted by journalist [[Mike Wallace]], Huxley outlined several major concerns: the difficulties and dangers of world overpopulation; the tendency toward distinctly hierarchical social organisation; the crucial importance of evaluating the use of technology in mass societies susceptible to wily persuasion; the tendency to promote modern politicians to a naive public as well-marketed commodities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ePNGa0m3XA |title=The Mike Wallace Interview: Aldous Huxley (18 May 1958) |publisher=YouTube |date=25 July 2011 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Post World War II ===\nIn 1953, Huxley and Maria applied for [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizenship]] and presented themselves for examination. When Huxley refused to bear arms for the US and would not state that his objections were based on religious ideals, the only excuse allowed under the [[McCarran Internal Security Act|McCarran Act]], the judge had to adjourn the proceedings.<ref name=\"Reiff2009\">{{cite book|author=Raychel Haugrud Reiff|title=Aldous Huxley: Brave New World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8JyRntokmqYC&pg=PA31|date=1 September 2009|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-4701-6|page=31}}</ref><ref name=\"Murray2009\">{{cite book|author=Nicholas Murray|title=Aldous Huxley: An English Intellectual|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7h7CKgXGDi4C&pg=PT309|date=4 June 2009|publisher=Little, Brown Book Group|isbn=978-0-7481-1231-9|page=309}}</ref> He withdrew his application. Nevertheless, he remained in the US. In 1959 Huxley turned down an offer of a [[Knight Bachelor]] by the [[Harold Macmillan#Prime Minister (1957\u20131963)|Macmillan government]] without putting forward a reason; his brother Julian had been knighted in 1958, while another brother Andrew would be knighted in 1974.<ref>''The New Encyclopaedia Britannica''. (2003). Volume 6. p. 178</ref>\n\n== Association with Vedanta ==\nBeginning in 1939 and continuing until his death in 1963, Huxley had an extensive association with the [[Vedanta Society of Southern California]], founded and headed by [[Swami Prabhavananda]]. Together with [[Gerald Heard]], [[Christopher Isherwood]], and other followers he was initiated by the Swami and was taught meditation and spiritual practices.{{sfn|Roy|2003}}\n\nIn 1944, Huxley wrote the introduction to the \"Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God\",<ref name=\"IsherwoodSwami Prabhavananda1987\">{{cite book |last1=Isherwood |first1=Christopher |last2=Swami Prabhavananda |last3=Aldous |first3=Huxley |title=Bhagavad Gita: The Song of God |year=1987 |publisher=Vedanta Press |location=Hollywood, Calif |isbn=978-0-87481-043-1}}</ref> translated by Swami Prabhavananda and Christopher Isherwood, which was published by The Vedanta Society of Southern California.\n\nFrom 1941 until 1960, Huxley contributed 48 articles to ''Vedanta and the West'', published by the society. He also served on the editorial board with Isherwood, Heard, and playwright John van Druten from 1951 through 1962.\n\nHuxley also occasionally lectured at the Hollywood and Santa Barbara Vedanta temples. Two of those lectures have been released on CD: ''[[Knowledge and Understanding]]'' and ''[[Who Are We? (album)|Who Are We?]]'' from 1955. Nonetheless, Huxley's agnosticism, together with his speculative propensity, made it difficult for him to fully embrace any form of institutionalized religion.<ref>[[Michel Weber]], \" [https://www.academia.edu/1564486/_Perennial_Truth_and_Perpetual_Perishing._A._Huxleys_Worldview_in_the_Light_of_A._N._Whiteheads_Process_Philosophy_of_Time_2007_ Perennial Truth and Perpetual Perishing.

Huxley had initiated a correspondence with [[Humphry Osmond|Dr. Humphry Osmond]], a British psychiatrist then employed in a Canadian institution, and eventually asked him to supply a dose of mescaline; Osmond obliged and supervised Huxley\u2019s session in southern California. After the publication of ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'', in which he recounted this experience, Huxley and Swami Prabhavananda disagreed about the meaning and importance of the psychedelic drug experience, which may have caused the relationship to cool, but Huxley continued to write articles for the society's journal, lecture at the temple, and attend social functions.\n\n== Eyesight ==\nThere are differing accounts about the details of the quality of Huxley's eyesight at specific points in his life. About 1939, Huxley encountered the [[Bates method]] for better eyesight, and a teacher, [[Margaret Darst Corbett]], who was able to teach the method to him. In 1940, Huxley relocated from Hollywood to a {{convert|40|acre|ha| adj =on}} ''ranchito'' in the high desert hamlet of [[Llano, California]], in northernmost Los Angeles County. Huxley then said that his sight improved dramatically with the Bates Method and the extreme and pure natural lighting of the southwestern American desert. He reported that, for the first time in more than 25 years, he was able to read without glasses and without strain. He even tried driving a car along the dirt road beside the ranch. He wrote a book about his successes with the Bates Method, ''[[The Art of Seeing]]'', which was published in 1942 (U.S.), 1943 (UK). The book contained some generally disputed theories, and its publication created a growing degree of popular controversy about Huxley's eyesight.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Aldous Huxley Annual|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYFcahCQm4wC&pg=PA109&dq=The+Art+of+Seeing+huxley&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiQ9K27y6zKAhUHKx4KHZ84DjAQuwUIVDAH#v=onepage&q=The%20Art%20of%20Seeing%20huxley&f=false|publisher = LIT Verlag M\u00fcnster|date = 28 February 2011|isbn = 978-3-643-10450-2|language = en|first = Bernfried|last = Nugel|first2 = Jerome|last2 = Meckier|page = 111|chapter = A New Look at The Art of Seeing}}</ref>\n\nIt was, and is, widely believed that Huxley was nearly blind since the illness in his teens, despite the partial recovery that had enabled him to study at Oxford. For example, some ten years after publication of ''The Art of Seeing'', in 1952, [[Bennett Cerf]] was present when Huxley spoke at a Hollywood banquet, wearing no glasses and apparently reading his paper from the lectern without difficulty: \"Then suddenly he faltered \u2014 and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory he brought the paper closer and closer to his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his pocket to make the typing visible to him. It was an agonising moment.\"<ref name=\"Gardner\">Cerf, Bennett (12 April 1952), ''The Saturday Review'' (column), quoted in {{cite book |last=Gardner |first=Martin | authorlink =Martin Gardner |title=[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]] |year=1957 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn = 978-0-486-20394-2}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, Huxley's second wife, [[Laura Archera]], would later emphasise in her biographical account, ''This Timeless Moment'': \"One of the great achievements of his life: that of having regained his sight.\" After revealing a letter she wrote to the ''Los Angeles Times'' disclaiming the label of Huxley as a \"poor fellow who can hardly see\" by [[Walter C. Alvarez]], she tempered this: \"Although I feel it was an injustice to treat Aldous as though he were blind, it is true there were many indications of his impaired vision. For instance, although Aldous did not wear glasses, he would quite often use a magnifying lens.\"<ref name=\"Huxley\">{{cite book |last=Huxley |first=Laura |title=This Timeless Moment |year=1968 |publisher= Farrar, Straus & Giroux |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-89087-968-9}}</ref> Laura Huxley proceeded to elaborate a few nuances of inconsistency peculiar to Huxley's vision. Her account, in this respect, is discernibly congruent with the following sample of Huxley's own words from ''The Art of Seeing'': \"The most characteristic fact about the functioning of the total organism, or any part of the organism, is that it is not constant, but highly variable.\" Nevertheless, the topic of Huxley's eyesight continues to endure similar, significant controversy, regardless of how trivial a subject matter it might initially appear.<ref>Rolfe, Lionel (1981) ''Literary LA'' p. 50. Chronicle Books, 1981. University of California.</ref>\n\nAmerican [[popular science]] author [[Steven Johnson (author)|Steven Johnson]], in his book ''Mind Wide Open'', quotes Huxley about his difficulties with [[Encoding (memory)#Visual encoding|visual encoding]]: \"I am and, for as long as I can remember, I have always been a poor visualizer. Words, even the pregnant words of poets, do not evoke pictures in my mind. No hypnagogic visions greet me on the verge of sleep.

In other cases, some groups were originally characterized as parasitic algae (e.g., ''[[Chlorochytrium]]''), but later were seen as [[endophytic]] algae.<ref>Round (1981). pp.&nbsp;398\u2013400, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Rm08AAAAIAAJ&lpg=PA262&hl=&pg=PA398].</ref> Some filamentous bacteria (e.g., ''[[Beggiatoa]]'') were originally seen as algae.

Asexual reproduction permits efficient population increases, but less variation is possible. Commonly, in sexual reproduction of unicellular and colonial algae, two specialized, sexually compatible, haploid gametes make physical contact and fuse to form a [[zygote]].

This dispersal can be accomplished by air, water, or other organisms. Due to this, spores can be found in a variety of environments: fresh and marine waters, air, soil, and in or on other organisms.<ref name=Round8/> Whether a spore is to grow into an organism depends on the combination of the species and the environmental conditions where the spore lands.\n\nThe spores of freshwater algae are dispersed mainly by running water and wind, as well as by living carriers.<ref name=Round8/> However, not all bodies of water can carry all species of algae, as the chemical composition of certain water bodies limits the algae that can survive within them.<ref name=Round8/> Marine spores are often spread by ocean currents. Ocean water presents many vastly different habitats based on temperature and nutrient availability, resulting in phytogeographic zones, regions, and provinces.<ref>Round (1981), page 362.</ref>\n\nTo some degree, the distribution of algae is subject to floristic discontinuities caused by geographical features, such as [[Antarctica]], long distances of ocean or general land masses. It is, therefore, possible to identify species occurring by locality, such as \"Pacific algae\" or \"North Sea algae\". When they occur out of their localities, hypothesizing a transport mechanism is usually possible, such as the hulls of ships. For example, ''Ulva reticulata'' and ''U. fasciata'' travelled from the mainland to Hawaii in this manner.\n\nMapping is possible for select species only: \"there are many valid examples of confined distribution patterns.\"<ref>Round (1981), Page 357.</ref> For example, ''Clathromorphum'' is an arctic genus and is not mapped far south of there.<ref>Round (1981), page 371.</ref> However, scientists regard the overall data as insufficient due to the \"difficulties of undertaking such studies.\"<ref>Round (1981), page 366.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\n[[File:Phytoplankton Lake Chuzenji.jpg|thumb|left|Phytoplankton, [[Lake Chuzenji]]]]\nAlgae are prominent in bodies of water, common in terrestrial environments, and are found in unusual environments, such as on [[Snow algae|snow]] and [[Ice algae|ice]].

Scientists developed the ATS, which consists of shallow, 100-foot raceways of nylon netting where algae colonies can form, and studied its efficacy for three years. They found that algae can readily be used to reduce the nutrient runoff from agricultural fields and increase the quality of water flowing into rivers, streams, and oceans. Researchers collected and dried the nutrient-rich algae from the ATS and studied its potential as an organic fertilizer. They found that cucumber and corn seedlings grew just as well using ATS organic fertilizer as they did with commercial fertilizers.<ref>{{cite web\n|url= http://www.ars.usda.gov/is/AR/archive/may10/algae0510.htm\n|title= Algae: A Mean, Green Cleaning Machine |publisher=USDA Agricultural Research Service\n|date=7 May 2010}}</ref> Algae scrubbers, using bubbling upflow or vertical waterfall versions, are now also being used to filter aquaria and ponds.\n\n===Bioremediation===\nThe alga ''[[Stichococcus bacillaris]]'' has been seen to colonize silicone resins used at archaeological sites; [[Biodegradation|biodegrading]] the synthetic substance.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Microorganisms Attack Synthetic Polymers in Items Representing Our Cultural Heritage |first1=Francesca |last1=Cappitelli |first2=Claudia |journal=Applied and Environmental Microbiology |year=2008 |volume=74 |pmc=2227722 |last2=Sorlini |issue=3 |pages=564\u2013569 |doi=10.1128/AEM.01768-07 |pmid=18065627}}</ref>\n\n===Pigments===\nThe natural [[pigment]]s ([[carotenoid]]s and [[chlorophyll]]s) produced by algae can be used as alternatives to chemical [[dye]]s and coloring agents.<ref>{{cite book| last = Arad| first = Shoshana| last2 = Spharim| first2 = Ishai| editor-last = Altman| editor-first = Arie| title = Agricultural Biotechnology| series = Books in Soils, Plants, and the Environment| volume = 61| year = 1998| publisher = CRC Press| isbn = 978-0-8247-9439-2| page = 638| contribution = Production of Valuable Products from Microalgae: An Emerging Agroindustry }}</ref>\nThe presence of some individual algal pigments, together with specific pigment concentration ratios, are taxon-specific: analysis of their concentrations with various analytical methods, particularly [[high-performance liquid chromatography]], can therefore offer deep insight into the taxonomic composition and relative abundance of natural alga populations in sea water samples.<ref>{{cite journal |author=C.

the differences among group means and their associated procedures (such as \"variation\" among and between groups), developed by [[statistician]] and [[evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Ronald Fisher]]. In the ANOVA setting, the observed [[variance]] in a particular variable is partitioned into components attributable to different sources of variation. In its simplest form, ANOVA provides a [[statistical test]] of whether or not the [[mean]]s of several groups are equal, and therefore generalizes the [[Student's t-test#Independent two-sample t-test|''t''-test]] to more than two groups.   ANOVAs are useful for comparing (testing) three or more means (groups or variables) for [[statistical significance]].  It is conceptually similar to [[Multiple comparisons problem|multiple two-sample t-tests]], but is more conservative (results in less [[type I error]]){{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and is therefore suited to a wide range of practical problems.\n{{TOC limit}}\n\n==History==\nWhile the analysis of variance reached fruition in the 20th century, antecedents extend centuries into the past according to Stigler.<ref>Stigler (1986)</ref>  These include hypothesis testing, the partitioning of sums of squares, experimental techniques and the additive model. [[Pierre-Simon Laplace|Laplace]] was performing hypothesis testing in the 1770s.<ref>Stigler (1986, p 134)</ref> The development of least-squares methods by Laplace and [[Carl Friedrich Gauss|Gauss]] circa 1800 provided an improved method of combining observations (over the existing practices then used in astronomy and geodesy). It also initiated much study of the contributions to sums of squares. Laplace soon knew how to estimate a variance from a residual (rather than a total) sum of squares.<ref>Stigler (1986, p 153)</ref> By 1827 Laplace was using least squares methods to address ANOVA problems regarding measurements of atmospheric tides.<ref>Stigler (1986, pp&nbsp;154\u2013155)</ref> Before 1800 astronomers had isolated observational errors resulting \nfrom reaction times (the \"[[personal equation]]\") and had developed methods of reducing the errors.<ref>Stigler (1986, pp&nbsp;240\u2013242)</ref>  The experimental methods used in the study of the personal equation were later accepted by the emerging field of psychology <ref>Stigler (1986, \nChapter 7 - Psychophysics as a Counterpoint)</ref> which developed strong (full factorial) experimental methods to which randomization and blinding were soon added.<ref>Stigler (1986, p 253)</ref>  An eloquent non-mathematical explanation of the additive effects model was\navailable in 1885.<ref>Stigler (1986, pp&nbsp;314\u2013315)</ref>\n\n[[Ronald Fisher]] introduced the term [[variance]] and proposed its formal analysis in a 1918 article ''[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]''.<ref>''The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance''. Ronald A. Fisher. ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of Edinburgh''. 1918. (volume 52, pages 399\u2013433)</ref>  His first application of the analysis of variance was published in 1921.<ref>On the \"Probable Error\" of a Coefficient of Correlation Deduced from a Small Sample. Ronald A. Fisher. Metron, 1: 3-32 (1921)</ref> Analysis of variance became widely known after being included in Fisher's 1925 book ''[[Statistical Methods for Research Workers]]''.\n\nRandomization models were developed by several researchers.  The first was published in Polish by [[Neyman]] in 1923.<ref>Scheff\u00e9 (1959, p 291, \"Randomization models were first formulated by \nNeyman (1923) for the completely randomized design, by Neyman (1935) for randomized blocks, by Welch (1937) and Pitman (1937) for the Latin square under a certain null hypothesis, and by Kempthorne (1952, 1955) and Wilk (1955) for many other designs.\")</ref>\n\nOne of the attributes of ANOVA which ensured its early popularity was computational elegance.  The structure of the additive model allows solution for the additive coefficients by simple algebra rather than by matrix calculations.  In the era of mechanical calculators this simplicity was critical.  The determination of statistical significance also required access to tables of the F function which were supplied by early statistics texts.\n\n==Motivating example==\n[[File:Anova, no fit..png|thumb|No fit.]][[File:ANOVA fair fit.jpg|thumb|Fair fit]][[File:ANOVA very good fit.jpg|thumb|Very good fit]]The analysis of variance can be used as an exploratory tool to explain observations.  A dog show provides an example.  A dog show is not a random sampling of the breed: it is typically limited to dogs that are adult, pure-bred, and exemplary.  A histogram of dog weights from a show might plausibly be rather complex, like the yellow-orange distribution shown in the illustrations.  Suppose we wanted to predict the weight of a dog based on a certain set of characteristics of each dog. Before we could do that, we would need to ''explain'' the distribution of weights by dividing the dog population into groups based on those characteristics. A successful grouping will split dogs such that (a) each group has a low variance of dog weights (meaning the group is relatively homogeneous) and (b) the mean of each group is distinct (if two groups have the same mean, then it isn't reasonable to conclude that the groups are, in fact, separate in any meaningful way).\nIn the illustrations to the right, each group is identified as ''X''<sub>1</sub>, ''X''<sub>2</sub>, etc. In the first illustration, we divide the dogs according to the product (interaction) of two binary groupings: young vs old, and short-haired vs long-haired (thus, group 1 is young, short-haired dogs, group 2 is young, long-haired dogs, etc.). Since the distributions of dog weight within each of the groups (shown in blue) has a large variance, and since the means are very close across groups, grouping dogs by these characteristics does not produce an effective way to explain the variation in dog weights: knowing which group a dog is in does not allow us to make any reasonable statements as to what that dog's weight is likely to be. Thus, this grouping fails to ''fit'' the distribution we are trying to explain (yellow-orange).\n\nAn attempt to explain the weight distribution by grouping dogs as (pet vs working breed) and (less athletic vs more athletic) would probably be somewhat more successful (fair fit).  The heaviest show dogs are likely to be big strong working breeds, while breeds kept as pets tend to be smaller and thus lighter.  As shown by the second illustration, the distributions have variances that are considerably smaller than in the first case, and the means are more reasonably distinguishable. However, the significant overlap of distributions, for example, means that we cannot reliably say that ''X''<sub>1</sub> and ''X''<sub>2</sub> are truly distinct (i.e., it is perhaps reasonably likely that splitting dogs according to the flip of a coin\u2014by pure chance\u2014might produce distributions that look similar).\n\nAn attempt to explain weight by breed is likely to produce a very good fit.  All Chihuahuas are light and all St Bernards are heavy.  The difference in weights between Setters and Pointers does not justify separate breeds.  The analysis of variance provides the formal tools to justify these intuitive judgments.  A common use of the method is the analysis of experimental data or the development of models.  The method has some advantages over correlation: not all of the data must be numeric and one result of the method is a judgment in the confidence in an explanatory relationship.\n\n==Background and terminology==\nANOVA is a particular form of [[statistical hypothesis testing]] heavily used in the analysis of experimental data.  A test  result (calculated from the [[null hypothesis]] and the sample) is called statistically significant if it is deemed unlikely to have occurred by chance, ''assuming the truth of the null hypothesis''. A statistically significant result, when a probability ([[p-value]]) is less than a threshold (significance level), justifies the rejection of the [[null hypothesis]], but only if the priori probability of the null hypothesis is not high.\n\nIn the typical application of ANOVA, the null hypothesis is that all groups are simply random samples of the same population. For example, when studying the effect of different treatments on similar samples of patients, the null hypothesis would be that all treatments have the same effect (perhaps none). Rejecting the null hypothesis would imply that different treatments result in altered effects.\n\nBy construction, hypothesis testing limits the rate of [[Type I errors]] (false positives) to a significance level.  Experimenters also wish to limit [[Type II errors]] (false negatives).  \nThe rate of Type II errors depends largely on sample size (the rate will increase for small numbers of samples), significance \nlevel (when the standard of proof is high, the chances of overlooking \na discovery are also high) and [[effect size]] (a smaller effect size is more prone to Type II error).\n\nThe terminology of ANOVA is largely from the statistical \n[[design of experiments]].  The experimenter adjusts factors and \nmeasures responses in an attempt to determine an effect.  Factors are \nassigned to experimental units by a combination of randomization and \n[[Randomized block design|blocking]] to ensure the validity of the results.  [[Blind experiment|Blinding]] keeps the\nweighing impartial.  Responses show a variability that is partially \nthe result of the effect and is partially random error.\n\nANOVA is the synthesis of several ideas and it is used for multiple \npurposes.  As a consequence, it is difficult to define concisely or precisely.\n\n\"Classical ANOVA for balanced data does three things at once:\n{{ordered list|start=1\n| As [[exploratory data analysis]], an ANOVA is an organization of an additive data decomposition, and its sums of squares indicate the variance of each component of the decomposition (or, equivalently, each set of terms of a linear model).\n| Comparisons of mean squares, along with an [[F-test]]&nbsp;... allow testing of a nested sequence of models.\n| Closely related to the ANOVA is a linear model fit with coefficient estimates and standard errors.\"<ref>Gelman (2005, p 2)</ref>\n}}\nIn short, ANOVA is a statistical tool used in several ways to develop and confirm an explanation for the observed data.\n\nAdditionally:\n{{ordered list|start=4\n| It is computationally elegant and relatively robust against violations of its assumptions.\n| ANOVA provides industrial strength (multiple sample comparison) statistical analysis.\n| It has been adapted to the analysis of a variety of experimental designs.\n}}\nAs a result:\nANOVA \"has long enjoyed the status of being the '''most used''' (some would \nsay abused) statistical technique in psychological research.\"<ref>\nHowell (2002, p 320)</ref>\nANOVA \"is probably the '''most useful''' technique in the field of \nstatistical inference.\"<ref>Montgomery (2001, p 63)</ref>\n\nANOVA is difficult to teach, particularly for complex experiments, with [[Restricted randomization|split-plot designs]] being notorious.<ref>Gelman (2005, p 1)</ref>  In some cases the proper \napplication of the method is best determined by problem pattern recognition \nfollowed by the consultation of a classic authoritative test.<ref>\nGelman (2005, p 5)</ref>\n\n===Design-of-experiments terms===\n(Condensed from the NIST Engineering Statistics handbook: Section 5.7.

Sometimes called dependent variable(s).\n; Treatment: A treatment is a specific combination of factor levels whose effect is to be compared with other treatments.\n\n== Classes of models ==\nThere are three classes of models used in the analysis of variance, and these are outlined here.\n\n===Fixed-effects models===\n{{Main|Fixed effects model}}\nThe fixed-effects model (class I) of analysis of variance applies to situations in which the experimenter applies one or more treatments to the subjects of the experiment to see whether the [[response variable]] values change. This allows the experimenter to estimate the ranges of response variable values that the treatment would generate in the population as a whole.\n\n===Random-effects models===\n{{Main|Random effects model}}\nRandom effects model (class II) is used when the treatments are not fixed. This occurs when the various factor levels are sampled from a larger population. Because the levels themselves are [[random variable]]s, some assumptions and the method of contrasting the treatments (a multi-variable generalization of simple differences) differ from the fixed-effects model.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Chapter 12: Experiments with random factors)</ref>\n\n===Mixed-effects models===\n{{Main|Mixed model}}\nA mixed-effects model (class III) contains experimental factors of both fixed and random-effects types, with appropriately different interpretations and analysis for the two types.\n\nExample:\nTeaching experiments could be performed by a college or university department \nto find a good introductory textbook, with each text considered a \ntreatment.  The fixed-effects model would compare a list of candidate \ntexts.  The random-effects model would determine whether important \ndifferences exist among a list of randomly selected texts.  The \nmixed-effects model would compare the (fixed) incumbent texts to \nrandomly selected alternatives.\n\nDefining fixed and random effects has proven elusive, with competing \ndefinitions arguably leading toward a linguistic quagmire.<ref>\nGelman (2005, pp. 20\u201321)</ref>\n\n==Assumptions==\nThe analysis of variance has been studied from several approaches, the most common of which uses a [[linear model]] that relates the response to the treatments and blocks. Note that the model is linear in parameters but may be nonlinear across factor levels. Interpretation is easy when data is balanced across factors but much deeper understanding is needed for unbalanced data.\n\n===Textbook analysis using a normal distribution===\nThe analysis of variance can be presented in terms of a [[linear model]], which makes the following assumptions about the [[probability distribution]] of the responses:<ref>{{cite book |title = Statistical Methods\n| last1 = Snedecor | first1 = George W. \n| last2 = Cochran | first2 = William G.\n| year = 1967 | edition = 6th | page = 321\n}}</ref><ref>Cochran & Cox (1992, p 48)</ref><ref>Howell (2002, p 323)</ref><ref>\n{{cite book | last1 = Anderson | first1 = David R.\n| last2 = Sweeney | first2 = Dennis J.\n| last3 = Williams | first3 = Thomas A.\n| title = Statistics for business and economics \n| publisher = West Pub.

This randomization is objective and declared before the experiment is carried out. The objective random-assignment is used to test the significance of the null hypothesis, following the ideas of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]] and [[Ronald Fisher]]. This design-based analysis was discussed and developed by [[Francis J. Anscombe]] at [[Rothamsted Experimental Station]] and by [[Oscar Kempthorne]] at [[Iowa State University]].<ref>Anscombe (1948)</ref> Kempthorne and his students make an assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'', which is discussed in the books of Kempthorne and [[David R. Cox]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n====Unit-treatment additivity====\nIn its simplest form, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity<ref group=\"nb\">Unit-treatment additivity is simply termed additivity\nin most texts.  Hinkelmann and Kempthorne add adjectives and\ndistinguish between additivity in the strict and broad senses.  This \nallows a detailed consideration of multiple error sources (treatment, \nstate, selection, measurement and sampling) on page 161.</ref> states that the observed response <math>y_{i,j}</math> from experimental unit <math>i</math> when receiving treatment <math>j</math> can be written as the sum of the unit's response <math>y_i</math> and the treatment-effect <math> t_j</math>, that is <ref>Kempthorne (1979, p 30)</ref><ref name=\"Cox\">Cox (1958, Chapter 2: Some Key Assumptions)</ref><ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Throughout.  Introduced in Section 2.3.3: Principles of experimental design; The linear model; Outline of a model)</ref>\n: <math>y_{i,j}=y_i+t_j.</math>\nThe assumption of unit-treatment additivity implies that, for every treatment <math>j</math>, the <math>j</math>th treatment has  exactly the same effect <math>t_j</math> on every experiment unit.\n\nThe assumption of unit treatment additivity  usually cannot be directly [[falsificationism|falsified]], according to Cox and Kempthorne. However, many ''consequences'' of treatment-unit additivity can be falsified. For a randomized experiment, the assumption of unit-treatment additivity ''implies'' that the variance is constant for all treatments. Therefore, by [[contraposition]], a necessary condition for unit-treatment additivity is that the variance is constant.\n\nThe use of unit treatment additivity and randomization is similar to the design-based inference that is standard in finite-population [[survey sampling]].\n\n====Derived linear model====\nKempthorne uses the randomization-distribution and the assumption of ''unit treatment additivity'' to produce a ''derived linear model'', very similar to the textbook model discussed previously.<ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.3: \nCompletely Randomized Design; Derived Linear Model)</ref>  The test statistics of this derived linear model are closely approximated by the test statistics of an appropriate normal linear model, according to approximation theorems and simulation studies.<ref name=\"HinkelmannKempthorne\">Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.6: Completely randomized design; Approximating the randomization test)</ref> However, there are differences. For example, the randomization-based analysis results in a small but (strictly) negative correlation between the observations.<ref>Bailey (2008, Chapter 2.14 \"A More General Model\" in Bailey, pp.&nbsp;38\u201340)</ref><ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Chapter 7: Comparison of Treatments)</ref> In the randomization-based analysis, there is ''no assumption'' of a ''normal'' distribution and certainly ''no assumption'' of ''independence''. On the contrary, ''the observations are dependent''!\n\nThe randomization-based analysis has the disadvantage that its exposition involves tedious algebra and extensive time.  Since the randomization-based analysis is complicated and is closely approximated by the approach using a normal linear model, most teachers emphasize the normal linear model approach. Few statisticians object to model-based analysis of balanced randomized experiments.\n\n====Statistical models for observational data====\nHowever, when applied to data from non-randomized experiments or [[observational study|observational studies]], model-based analysis lacks the warrant of randomization.<ref>\nKempthorne (1979, pp 125\u2013126, \n\"The experimenter must decide which of the various causes that he \nfeels will produce variations in his results must be controlled \nexperimentally.  Those causes that he does not control experimentally, \nbecause he is not cognizant of them, he must control by the device of \nrandomization.\"  \"[O]nly when the treatments in the experiment are \napplied by the experimenter using the full randomization procedure is \nthe chain of inductive inference sound.  It is ''only'' under these \ncircumstances that the experimenter can attribute whatever effects he \nobserves to the treatment and the treatment only.  Under these \ncircumstances his conclusions are reliable in the statistical sense.\")  \n</ref> For observational data, the derivation of confidence intervals must use ''subjective'' models, as emphasized by [[Ronald Fisher]] and his followers. In practice, the estimates of treatment-effects from observational studies  generally are often inconsistent.  In practice, \"statistical models\" and observational data are useful for suggesting hypotheses that should be treated very cautiously by the public.<ref>Freedman {{full citation needed|date=November 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Summary of assumptions===\nThe normal-model based ANOVA analysis assumes the independence, normality and \nhomogeneity of the variances of the residuals. The \nrandomization-based analysis assumes only the homogeneity of the \nvariances of the residuals (as a consequence of unit-treatment \nadditivity) and uses the randomization procedure of the experiment. \nBoth these analyses require [[homoscedasticity]], as an assumption for the normal-model analysis and as a consequence of randomization and additivity for the randomization-based analysis.\n\nHowever, studies of processes that \nchange variances rather than means (called dispersion effects) have \nbeen successfully conducted using ANOVA.<ref>Montgomery \n(2001, Section 3.8: Discovering dispersion effects)</ref>  There are\n''no'' necessary assumptions for ANOVA in its full generality, but the\nF-test used for ANOVA hypothesis testing has assumptions and practical \nlimitations which are of continuing interest.\n\nProblems which do not satisfy the assumptions of ANOVA can often be transformed to satisfy the assumptions. \nThe property of unit-treatment additivity is not invariant under a \"change of scale\", so statisticians often use transformations to achieve unit-treatment additivity. If the response variable is expected to follow a parametric family of probability distributions, then the statistician may specify (in the protocol for the experiment or observational study) that the responses be transformed to stabilize the variance.<ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.10: Completely randomized design; Transformations)</ref> Also, a statistician may specify that logarithmic transforms be applied to the responses, which are believed to follow a multiplicative model.<ref name=\"Cox\" /><ref>Bailey (2008)</ref>\nAccording to Cauchy's [[functional equation]] theorem, the [[logarithm]] is the only continuous transformation that transforms real multiplication to addition.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\n==Characteristics==\nANOVA is used in the analysis of comparative experiments, those in \nwhich only the difference in outcomes is of interest.  The statistical\nsignificance of the experiment is determined by a ratio of two \nvariances.  This ratio is independent of several possible alterations\nto the experimental observations: Adding a constant to all \nobservations does not alter significance.  Multiplying all \nobservations by a constant does not alter significance.  So ANOVA \nstatistical significance result is independent of constant bias and \nscaling errors as well as the units used in expressing observations.  \nIn the era of mechanical calculation it was common to \nsubtract a constant from all observations (when equivalent to \ndropping leading digits) to simplify data entry.<ref>Montgomery \n(2001, Section 3-3: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of \nvariance; Analysis of the fixed effects model)</ref><ref>\nCochran & Cox (1992, p 2 example)</ref>  This is an example of data\n[[Coding (social sciences)|coding]].\n\n==Logic==\nThe calculations of ANOVA can be characterized as computing a number\nof means and variances, dividing two variances and comparing the ratio \nto a handbook value to determine statistical significance.  Calculating \na treatment effect is then trivial, \"the effect of any treatment is \nestimated by taking the difference between the mean of the \nobservations which receive the treatment and the general mean\".<ref>\nCochran & Cox (1992, p 49)</ref>\n\n===Partitioning of the sum of squares===\n{{main|Partition of sums of squares}}\nANOVA uses traditional standardized terminology.  The definitional \nequation of sample variance is\n<math>s^2=\\textstyle\\frac{1}{n-1}\\sum(y_i-\\bar{y})^2</math>, where the \ndivisor is called the degrees of freedom (DF), the summation is called \nthe sum of squares (SS), the result is called the mean square (MS) and \nthe squared terms are deviations from the sample mean.  ANOVA \nestimates 3 sample variances: a total variance based on all the \nobservation deviations from the grand mean, an error variance based on \nall the observation deviations from their appropriate \ntreatment means, and a treatment variance.  The treatment variance is\nbased on the deviations of treatment means from the grand mean, the \nresult being multiplied by the number of observations in each \ntreatment to account for the difference between the variance of \nobservations and the variance of means.\n\nThe fundamental technique is a partitioning of the total [[sum of squares (statistics)|sum of squares]] ''SS'' into components related to the effects used in the model. For example, the model for a simplified ANOVA with one type of treatment at different levels.\n\n:<math>SS_\\text{Total} = SS_\\text{Error} + SS_\\text{Treatments}</math>\n\nThe number of [[Degrees of freedom (statistics)|degrees of freedom]] ''DF'' can be partitioned in a similar way: one of these components (that for error) specifies a [[chi-squared distribution]] which describes the associated sum of squares, while the same is true for \"treatments\" if there is no treatment effect.\n\n:<math>DF_\\text{Total} = DF_\\text{Error} + DF_\\text{Treatments}</math>\n\nSee also [[Lack-of-fit sum of squares]].\n\n===The F-test===\n{{Main|F-test}}\nThe [[F-test]] is used for comparing the factors of the total deviation. For example, in one-way, or single-factor ANOVA, statistical significance is tested for by comparing the F test statistic\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{\\text{variance between treatments}}{\\text{variance within treatments}}</math>\n\n:<math>F = \\frac{MS_\\text{Treatments}}{MS_\\text{Error}} = {{SS_\\text{Treatments} / (I-1)} \\over {SS_\\text{Error} / (n_T-I)}}</math>\nwhere  ''MS'' is mean square, <math>I</math>  = number of treatments and \n<math>n_T</math> = total number of cases\n\nto the [[F-distribution]] with <math>I - 1</math>, <math>n_T - I</math>  degrees of freedom. Using the [[F-distribution]] is a natural candidate because the test statistic is the ratio of two scaled sums of squares each of which follows a scaled [[chi-squared distribution]].\n\nThe expected value of F is <math>1 + {n \\sigma^2_\\text{Treatment}} / \n{\\sigma^2_\\text{Error}}</math> (where n is the treatment sample size)\nwhich is 1 for no treatment effect.  As values of F increase above 1, the evidence is increasingly inconsistent with the null hypothesis. Two apparent experimental methods of increasing F are increasing the sample size and reducing the error variance by tight experimental controls.\n\nThere are two methods of concluding the ANOVA hypothesis test, both of which produce the same result:\n* The textbook method is to compare the observed value of F with the critical value of F determined from tables. The critical value of F is a function of the degrees of freedom of the numerator and the denominator and the significance level (\u03b1).  If F \u2265 F<sub>Critical</sub>, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n* The computer method calculates the probability (p-value) of a value of F greater than or equal to the observed value.  The null hypothesis is rejected if this probability is less than or equal to the significance level (\u03b1).\nThe ANOVA F-test is known to be nearly optimal in the sense of minimizing false negative errors for a fixed rate of false positive errors (i.e. maximizing power for a fixed significance level). For example, to test the hypothesis that various medical treatments have exactly the same effect, the [[F-test]]'s p-values closely approximate the [[permutation test]]'s [[p-value]]s: The approximation is particularly close when the design is balanced.<ref name=\"HinkelmannKempthorne\" /><ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 6.7: Completely randomized design; CRD with unequal numbers of replications)</ref> Such [[permutation test]]s characterize [[uniformly most powerful test|tests with maximum power]] against all [[alternative hypothesis|alternative hypotheses]], as observed by Rosenbaum.<ref group=\"nb\">Rosenbaum (2002, page 40) cites Section 5.7 (Permutation Tests), Theorem 2.3 (actually Theorem 3, page 184) of [[Erich Leo Lehmann|Lehmann]]'s ''Testing Statistical Hypotheses'' (1959).</ref> The ANOVA F\u2013test (of the null-hypothesis that all treatments have exactly the same effect) is recommended as a practical test, because of its robustness against many alternative distributions.<ref>Moore and McCabe (2003, page 763)</ref><ref group=\"nb\">The F-test for the comparison of variances has a mixed reputation.  It \nis not recommended as a hypothesis test to determine whether two \n''different'' samples have the same variance.  It is recommended for \nANOVA where two estimates of the variance of the ''same'' \nsample are compared.  While the F-test is not generally robust against \ndepartures from normality, it has been found to be robust in the \nspecial case of ANOVA.

Moore & McCabe recommend a rule of thumb.</ref>\n\n===Extended logic===\nANOVA consists of separable parts; partitioning sources of variance \nand hypothesis testing can be used individually.  ANOVA is used to \nsupport other statistical tools.  Regression is first used to fit more \ncomplex models to data, then ANOVA is used to compare models with the \nobjective of selecting simple(r) models that adequately describe the \ndata.  \"Such models could be fit without any reference to ANOVA, but \nANOVA tools could then be used to make some sense of the fitted models, \nand to test hypotheses about batches of coefficients.\"<ref name=\"Gelman\">Gelman (2008)</ref>  \n\"[W]e think of the analysis of variance as a way of understanding and structuring \nmultilevel models\u2014not as an alternative to regression but as a tool \nfor summarizing complex high-dimensional inferences&nbsp;...\"<ref name=\"Gelman\" />\n\n==For a single factor==\n{{Main|One-way analysis of variance}}\nThe simplest experiment suitable for ANOVA analysis is the completely \nrandomized experiment with a single factor.  More complex experiments \nwith a single factor involve constraints on randomization and include \ncompletely randomized blocks and Latin squares (and variants: \nGraeco-Latin squares, etc.).  The more complex experiments share many \nof the complexities of multiple factors.  A relatively complete \ndiscussion of the analysis (models, data summaries, ANOVA table) of \nthe completely randomized experiment is \n[[One-way analysis of variance|available]].\n\n==For multiple factors==\n{{Main|Two-way analysis of variance}}\nANOVA generalizes to the study of the effects of multiple factors.  \nWhen the experiment includes observations at all combinations of \nlevels of each factor, it is termed [[Factorial experiment|factorial]].  \nFactorial experiments \nare more efficient than a series of single factor experiments and the \nefficiency grows as the number of factors increases.<ref name=\"Montgomery\">Montgomery \n(2001, Section 5-2: Introduction to factorial designs; The advantages \nof factorials)</ref>  Consequently, factorial designs are heavily used.\n\nThe use of ANOVA to study the effects of multiple factors has a complication.  In a 3-way ANOVA with factors x, y and z, the ANOVA model includes terms for the main effects (x, y, z) and terms for [[Interaction (statistics)|interactions]] (xy, xz, yz, xyz).  \nAll terms require hypothesis tests.  The proliferation of interaction terms increases the risk that some hypothesis test will produce a false positive by chance. Fortunately, experience says that high order interactions are rare.<ref>Belle (2008, Section 8.4: High-order interactions occur rarely)</ref>   {{verify source|date=December 2014}}\nThe ability to detect interactions is a major advantage of multiple \nfactor ANOVA.  Testing one factor at a time hides interactions, but \nproduces apparently inconsistent experimental results.<ref name=\"Montgomery\" />\n\nCaution is advised when encountering interactions; Test  \ninteraction terms first and expand the analysis beyond ANOVA if \ninteractions are found.  Texts vary in their recommendations regarding \nthe continuation of the ANOVA procedure after encountering an \ninteraction.  Interactions complicate the interpretation of \nexperimental data.  Neither the calculations of significance nor the \nestimated treatment effects can be taken at face value.  \"A \nsignificant interaction will often mask the significance of main effects.\"<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 5-1: Introduction to factorial designs; Basic definitions and principles)</ref>  Graphical methods are recommended\nto enhance understanding.  Regression is often useful.  A lengthy discussion of interactions is available in Cox (1958).<ref>Cox (1958, \nChapter 6: Basic ideas about factorial experiments)</ref>  Some interactions can be removed (by transformations) while others cannot.\n\nA variety of techniques are used with multiple factor ANOVA to reduce expense. One technique used in factorial designs is to minimize replication (possibly no replication with support of [[Tukey's test of additivity|analytical trickery]]) and to combine groups when effects are found to be statistically (or practically) insignificant.  An experiment with many insignificant factors may collapse into one with a few factors supported by many replications.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 5-3.7: Introduction to factorial designs; The two-factor factorial design; One observation per cell)</ref>\n\n==Worked numeric examples==\nSeveral fully worked numerical examples are available.  A \n[[F-test#One-way ANOVA example|simple case]] uses one-way (a single factor) analysis.  A [[Two-way analysis of variance|more complex case]] uses two-way (two-factor) analysis.\n\n==Associated analysis==\nSome analysis is required in support of the ''design'' of the experiment while other analysis is performed after changes in the factors are formally found to produce statistically significant changes in the responses.  Because experimentation is iterative, the results of one experiment alter plans for following experiments.\n\n===Preparatory analysis===\n\n====The number of experimental units====\n\nIn the design of an experiment, the number of experimental units is planned to satisfy the goals of the experiment. Experimentation is often sequential.\n\nEarly experiments are often designed to provide mean-unbiased estimates of treatment effects and of experimental error. Later experiments are often designed to test a hypothesis that a treatment effect has an important magnitude; in this case, the number of experimental units is chosen so that the experiment is within budget and has adequate power, among other goals.\n\nReporting sample size analysis is generally required in psychology. \"Provide information on sample size and the process that led to sample size decisions.\"<ref>Wilkinson (1999, p 596)</ref>  The analysis, which is written in the experimental protocol before the experiment is conducted, is examined in grant applications and administrative review boards.\n\nBesides the power analysis, there are less formal methods for selecting the number of experimental units. These include graphical methods based on limiting\nthe probability of false negative errors, graphical methods based on an expected variation increase (above the residuals) and methods based on achieving a desired confident interval.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-7: Determining sample size)</ref>\n\n====Power analysis====\n[[Statistical power|Power analysis]] is often applied in the context of ANOVA in order to assess the probability of successfully rejecting the null hypothesis if we assume a certain ANOVA design, effect size in the population, sample size and significance level. Power analysis can assist in study design by determining what sample size would be required in order to have a reasonable chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when the alternative hypothesis is true.<ref>Howell (2002, Chapter 8: Power)</ref><ref>Howell (2002, Section 11.12: Power (in ANOVA))</ref><ref>Howell (2002, Section 13.7: Power analysis for factorial experiments)</ref><ref>Moore and McCabe (2003, pp 778\u2013780)</ref>\n\n====Effect size====\n{{Main|Effect size}}\nSeveral standardized measures of effect have been proposed for ANOVA to summarize the strength of the association between a predictor(s) and the dependent variable (e.g., &eta;<sup>2</sup>, &omega;<sup>2</sup>, or &fnof;<sup>2</sup>) or the overall standardized difference (&Psi;) of the complete model. Standardized effect-size estimates facilitate comparison of findings across studies and disciplines.  However, while standardized effect sizes are commonly used in much of the professional literature, a non-standardized measure of effect size that has immediately \"meaningful\" units may be preferable for reporting purposes.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\">Wilkinson (1999, p 599)</ref>\n\n===Follow-up analysis===\nIt is always appropriate to carefully consider outliers.  They have a disproportionate impact on statistical conclusions and are often the result of errors.\n\n====Model confirmation====\nIt is prudent to verify that the assumptions of ANOVA have been met. Residuals are examined or analyzed to confirm [[homoscedasticity]] and gross normality.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-4: Model adequacy checking)</ref>  Residuals should have the appearance of (zero mean normal distribution) noise when plotted as a function of anything including time and \nmodeled data values. Trends hint at interactions among factors or among observations.  One rule of thumb: \"If the largest standard deviation is less than twice the smallest standard deviation, we can use methods based on the assumption of equal standard deviations and our results \nwill still be approximately correct.\"<ref>Moore and McCabe (2003, p 755, Qualifications to this rule appear in a footnote.)</ref>\n\n====Follow-up tests====\nA statistically significant effect in ANOVA is often followed up with one or more different follow-up tests. This can be done in order to assess which groups are different from which other groups or to test various other focused hypotheses. Follow-up tests are often distinguished in terms of whether they are planned ([[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]) or [[Post-hoc analysis|post hoc]]. Planned tests are determined before looking at the data and post hoc tests are performed after looking at the data.\n\nOften one of the \"treatments\" is none, so the treatment group can act as a control.  [[Dunnett's test]] (a modification of the t-test) tests whether each of the other treatment groups has the same \nmean as the control.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5.8: Experiments with a single factor: The analysis of \nvariance; Practical interpretation of results; Comparing means with a control)</ref>\n\nPost hoc tests such as [[Tukey's range test]] most commonly compare every group mean with every other group mean and typically incorporate some method of controlling for Type I errors. Comparisons, which are most commonly planned, can be either simple or compound. Simple comparisons compare one group mean with one other group mean. Compound comparisons typically compare two sets of groups means where one set has two or more groups (e.g., compare average group means of group A, B and C with group D). Comparisons can also look at tests of trend, such as linear and quadratic relationships, when the independent variable involves ordered levels.\n\nFollowing ANOVA with pair-wise multiple-comparison tests has been criticized on several grounds.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" /><ref>Hinkelmann and Kempthorne (2008, Volume 1, Section 7.5: \nComparison of Treatments; Multiple Comparison Procedures)</ref> There are many such tests (10 in one table) and recommendations regarding their use are vague or conflicting.<ref>Howell (2002, Chapter 12: Multiple comparisons among treatment means)</ref><ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-5: Practical interpretation of results)</ref>\n\n==Study designs==\nThere are several types of ANOVA. Many statisticians base ANOVA on the [[experimental design|design of the experiment]],<ref>Cochran & Cox (1957, p 9,\n\"[T]he general rule [is] that the way in which the experiment is conducted determines not only whether inferences can be made, but also the calculations required to make them.\")</ref> especially on the protocol that specifies the [[random assignment]] of treatments to subjects; the protocol's description of the assignment mechanism should include a specification of the structure of the treatments and of any [[blocking (statistics)|blocking]]. It is also common to apply ANOVA to observational data using an appropriate statistical model.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}\n\nSome popular designs use the following types of ANOVA:\n*[[One-way ANOVA]] is used to test for differences among two or more [[statistical independence|independent]] groups (means),e.g. different levels of urea application in a crop, or different levels of antibiotic action on several bacterial species,<ref>[http://www.biomedicalstatistics.info/en/multiplegroups/one-way-anova.html One-way/single factor ANOVA.

Typically, however, the one-way ANOVA is used to test for differences among at least three groups, since the two-group case can be covered by a [[t-test]].<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1093/biomet/6.1.1 \n| title = The Probable Error of a Mean \n| journal = Biometrika \n| volume = 6 \n| pages = 1\u201325\n| year = 1908 \n| pmid =  \n| pmc = \n}}</ref> When there are only two means to compare, the [[t-test]] and the ANOVA [[F-test]] are equivalent; the relation between ANOVA and ''t'' is given by ''F''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''t''<sup>2</sup>.\n*[[Factorial experiment|Factorial]] ANOVA is used when the experimenter wants to study the interaction effects among the treatments.\n*[[Repeated measures]] ANOVA is used when the same subjects are used for each treatment (e.g., in a [[longitudinal study]]).\n*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA) is used when there is more than one [[dependent variable|response variable]].\n\n==Cautions==\nBalanced experiments (those with an equal sample size for each treatment) are relatively easy to interpret; Unbalanced \nexperiments offer more complexity.  For single factor (one way) ANOVA, the adjustment for unbalanced data is easy, but the unbalanced analysis lacks both robustness and power.<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-3.4: Unbalanced data)</ref>  For more complex designs the lack of balance leads to further complications. \"The orthogonality property of main effects and interactions present in balanced data does not carry over to the unbalanced case. This means that the usual analysis of variance techniques do not apply.  \nConsequently, the analysis of unbalanced factorials is much more difficult than that for balanced designs.\"<ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 14-2: Unbalanced data in factorial design)</ref>  In the general case, \"The analysis of variance can also be applied to unbalanced data, but then the sums of squares, mean squares, and F-ratios will depend on the order in which the sources of variation \nare considered.\"<ref name=\"Gelman\" />  The simplest techniques for handling unbalanced data restore balance by either throwing out data or by synthesizing missing data.  More complex techniques use regression.\n\nANOVA is (in part) a significance test.  The American Psychological Association holds the view that simply reporting significance is insufficient and that reporting confidence bounds is preferred.<ref name=\"Wilkinson\" />\n\nWhile ANOVA is conservative (in maintaining a significance level) against [[multiple comparisons]] in one dimension, it is not conservative against comparisons in multiple dimensions.<ref>Wilkinson (1999, p 600)</ref>\n\n==Generalizations==\nANOVA is considered to be a special case of [[linear regression]]<ref>Gelman (2005, p.1) (with qualification in the later text)</ref><ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3.9: The Regression Approach to the Analysis of Variance)</ref> which in turn is a special case of the [[general linear model]].<ref>Howell (2002, p 604)</ref> All consider the observations to be the sum of a model (fit) and a residual (error) to be minimized.\n\nThe [[Kruskal&ndash;Wallis test]] and the [[Friedman test]] are [[nonparametric]] tests, which  do not rely on an assumption of normality.<ref>Howell (2002, Chapter 18: Resampling and nonparametric approaches to data)</ref><ref>Montgomery (2001, Section 3-10: Nonparametric methods in the analysis of variance)</ref>\n\n===Connection to linear regression===\nBelow we make clear the connection between multi-way ANOVA and linear regression. Linearly re-order the data so that <math>k^\\text{th}</math> observation is associated with a response <math>y_k</math> and factors <math>Z_{k,b}</math> where <math>b \\in \\{1,2,\\ldots,B\\}</math> denotes the different factors and <math>B</math> is the total number of factors. In one-way ANOVA <math>B=1</math> and in two-way ANOVA <math>B=2</math>. Furthermore, we assume the <math>b^{th}</math> factor has <math>I_b</math> levels. Now, we can [[one-hot]] encode the factors into the <math> \\prod_{b=1}^B I_b</math> dimensional vector <math>v_k</math>.\n\nThe one-hot encoding function <math>g_b : I_b \\mapsto \\{0,1\\}^{I_b}</math> is defined such that the <math>i^{th}</math> entry of <math>g_b(Z_{k,b})</math> is\n<math display=\"block\">\ng_b(Z_{k,b})_i = \\begin{cases} 1 & \\text{if } i=Z_{k,b} \\\\\n 0 & \\text{otherwise} \\end{cases}\n</math>\nThe vector <math>v_k</math> is the concatenation of all of the above vectors for all <math>b</math>. Thus, <math>v_k = [g_1(Z_{k,1}), g_2(Z_{k,2}), \\ldots, g_B(Z_{k,B})]</math>. In order to obtain a fully general <math>B</math>-way interaction ANOVA we must also concatenate every additional interaction term in the vector <math>v_k</math> and then add an intercept term.  Let that vector be <math>x_k</math>.\n\nWith this notation in place, we now have the exact connection with linear regression. We simply regress response <math>y_k</math> against the vector <math>X_k</math>. However, there is a concern about identifiability. In order to overcome such issues we assume that the sum of the parameters within each set of interactions is equal to zero. From here, one can use F-statistics or other methods to determine the relevance of the individual factors.\n\n====Example====\nWe can consider the 2-way interaction example where we assume that the first factor has 2 levels and the second factor has 3 levels.\n\nDefine <math>a_i = 1</math> if <math>Z_{k,1}=i</math> and <math>b_i = 1</math> if <math>Z_{k,2}=i</math>, i.e. <math>a</math> is the one-hot encoding of the first factor and <math>b</math> is the one-hot encoding of the second factor.\n\nWith that,\n<math display=\"block\">\nX_k = [a_1,a_2,b_1,b_2,b_3,a_1 \\times b_1,a_1 \\times b_2, a_1 \\times b_3, a_2 \\times b_1, a_2 \\times b_2, a_2 \\times b_3,1]\n</math>\nwhere the last term is an intercept term. For a more concrete example suppose that\n<math display=\"block\">\n\\begin{align}\nZ_{k,1} & = 2 \\\\\nZ_{k,2} & = 1\n\\end{align}\n</math>\nThen,\n<math display=\"block\">\nX_k = [0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]\n</math>\n\n==See also==\n{{Commons category|Analysis of variance}}\n\n{{colbegin||20em}}\n*[[AMOVA]] (analysis of molecular variance)\n*[[Analysis of covariance]] (ANCOVA)\n*[[ANORVA]] (analysis of rhythmic variance)\n*[[ANOVA on ranks]]\n*[[ANOVA-simultaneous component analysis]]\n*[[Explained variation]]\n*[[Mixed-design analysis of variance]]\n*[[Multivariate analysis of variance]] (MANOVA)\n*[[One-way analysis of variance]]\n*[[Permutational analysis of variance]]\n*[[Repeated measures design#Repeated measures ANOVA|Repeated measures ANOVA]]\n*[[Two-way analysis of variance]]\n*[[Variance decomposition]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|group=\"nb\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n* {{cite journal|doi=10.2307/2984159|title=The Validity of Comparative Experiments|authorlink=Francis J.

In other words, an alkane consists of [[hydrogen]] and [[carbon]] atoms arranged in a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure in which all the [[C-C bond|carbon-carbon bonds]] are [[single bond|single]].<ref name=\"merriam-webster\">{{cite web|url=http://goldbook.iupac.org/A00222.html|title=Alkane - Definition  from the ''Compendium of Chemical Terminology''|publisher=iupac.org|accessdate=14 June 2016}}</ref> Alkanes have the general chemical formula {{Carbon}}<sub>''n''</sub>{{Hydrogen}}<sub>2''n''+2</sub>.

The longest series of linked carbon atoms in a molecule is known as its [[skeletal formula|carbon skeleton]] or carbon backbone. The number of carbon atoms may be thought of as the size of the alkane.\n\nOne group of the [[higher alkanes]] are [[wax]]es, solids at '''standard [[ambient temperature]] and pressure''' ('''SATP'''), for which the number of carbons in the carbon backbone is greater than about 17.\n\nWith their repeated -CH<sub>2</sub>- units, the alkanes constitute a [[homologous series]] of organic compounds in which the members differ in [[molecular mass]] by multiples of 14.03&nbsp;[[atomic mass unit|u]] (the total mass of each such [[methylene bridge|methylene-bridge]] unit, which comprises a single carbon atom of mass 12.01&nbsp;u and two hydrogen atoms of mass ~1.01&nbsp;u each).\n\nAlkanes are not very reactive and have little [[biological activity]].

They can be:\n* linear (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}) wherein the carbon atoms are joined in a snake-like structure\n* branched (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''+2}}, ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2) wherein the carbon backbone splits off in one or more directions\n* [[Cyclic compound|cyclic]] (general formula {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''}}, ''n''&nbsp;>&nbsp;3) wherein the carbon backbone is linked so as to form a loop.\n\nAccording to the definition by [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]], the former two are alkanes, whereas the third group is called [[cycloalkane]]s.<ref>{{GoldBookRef | title=alkanes | file = A00222 | date = 1995}}</ref> Saturated hydrocarbons can also combine any of the linear, cyclic (e.g., polycyclic) and branching structures; the general formula is  {{chem|C|''n''|H|2''n''\u22122''k''+2}}, where ''k'' is the number of independent loops. Alkanes are the [[Open chain compound|acyclic]] (loopless) ones, corresponding to ''k''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0.\n\n==Isomerism==\n[[Image:Saturated C4 hydrocarbons ball-and-stick.png|thumb|right| Different C<sub>4</sub> alkanes and cycloalkanes (left to right): [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]] are the two C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> isomers; [[cyclobutane]] and [[methylcyclopropane]] are the two C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub> isomers.<br /> Bicyclo[1.1.0]butane is the only C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>6</sub> compound and has no isomer; [[tetrahedrane]] (below) is the only C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub> compound and also has no isomer.]]\n\n[[File:Tetrahedrane-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|100px|[[Tetrahedrane]] ]]\n\nAlkanes with more than three [[carbon]] atoms can be arranged in various different ways, forming [[structural isomer]]s. The simplest isomer of an alkane is the one in which the carbon atoms are arranged in a single chain with no branches. This isomer is sometimes called the ''n''-isomer (''n'' for \"normal\", although it is not necessarily the most common). However the chain of carbon atoms may also be branched at one or more points. The number of possible isomers increases rapidly with the number of carbon atoms. For example:<ref name= OEIS >[[On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences]] {{OEIS|id=A000602}}</ref>\n* C<sub>1</sub>: [[methane]] only\n* C<sub>2</sub>: [[ethane]] only\n* C<sub>3</sub>: [[propane]] only\n* C<sub>4</sub>: 2 isomers: [[n-butane|''n''-butane]] and [[isobutane]]\n* C<sub>5</sub>: 3 isomers: [[pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]]\n* C<sub>6</sub>: 5 isomers: [[hexane]], [[2-Methylpentane|2-methylpentane]], [[3-Methylpentane|3-methylpentane]], [[2,2-Dimethylbutane|2,2-dimethylbutane]], and [[2,3-Dimethylbutane|2,3-dimethylbutane]]\n* C<sub>12</sub>: 355 isomers\n* C<sub>32</sub>: 27,711,253,769 isomers\n* C<sub>60</sub>: 22,158,734,535,770,411,074,184 isomers, many of which are not stable.\n\nBranched alkanes can be [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]]. For example, [[3-methylhexane]] and its higher [[Homology (chemistry)|homologues]] are chiral due to their [[stereogenic center]] at carbon atom number 3. In addition to the alkane isomers, the chain of carbon atoms may form one or more loops. Such compounds are called [[cycloalkane]]s.\n\n==Nomenclature==\n{{Main article|IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry}}\nThe [[IUPAC nomenclature of organic chemistry#Alkanes|IUPAC nomenclature]] (systematic way of naming compounds) for alkanes is based on identifying hydrocarbon chains. Unbranched, saturated hydrocarbon chains are named systematically with a Greek numerical prefix denoting the number of carbons and the suffix \"-ane\".<ref>{{cite book | url = http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_184.htm | accessdate = 12 February 2007 | chapter = R-2.2.1: Hydrocarbons | author = IUPAC, Commission on Nomenclature of Organic Chemistry | title = A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds (Recommendations 1993) | year = 1993 | publisher = Blackwell Scientific | isbn = 0-632-03488-2}}</ref>\n\nIn 1866, [[August Wilhelm von Hofmann]] suggested systematizing nomenclature by using the whole sequence of vowels a, e, i, o and u to create suffixes -ane, -ene, -ine (or -yne), -one, -une, for the [[hydrocarbons]]  C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2''n''</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2''n''\u22122</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2''n''\u22124</sub>, C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2''n''\u22126</sub>.<ref>[http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html Alkane Nomenclature<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202091842/http://www.chem.yale.edu/~chem125/125/history99/5Valence/Nomenclature/alkanenames.html |date=2 February 2012 }}</ref> Now, the first three name hydrocarbons with single, double and triple bonds;<ref>Thus, the ending \"-diene\" is applied in some cases where von Hofmann had \"-ine\"</ref> \"-one\" represents a [[ketone]]; \"-ol\" represents an alcohol or OH group; \"-oxy-\" means an [[ether]] and refers to oxygen between two carbons, so that methoxymethane is the IUPAC name for [[dimethyl ether]].\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to find compounds with more than one [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] name. This is because shorter chains attached to longer chains are prefixes and the convention includes brackets. Numbers in the name, referring to which carbon a group is attached to, should be as low as possible so that 1- is implied and usually omitted from names of organic compounds with only one side-group. Symmetric compounds will have two ways of arriving at the same name.\n\n===Linear alkanes===\n<!-- redirected from [[linear paraffins]] -->\nStraight-chain alkanes are sometimes indicated by the prefix \"''n''-\" (for ''normal'') where a non-linear [[isomer]] exists. Although this is not strictly necessary, the usage is still common in cases where there is an important difference in properties between the straight-chain and branched-chain isomers, e.g., [[hexane|''n''-hexane]] or 2- or 3-methylpentane. Alternative names for this group are: '''linear paraffins''' or '''''n''-paraffins'''.\n\nThe members of the series (in terms of number of carbon atoms) are named as follows:\n:[[methane]], CH<sub>4</sub> \u2013 one carbon and four hydrogen\n:[[ethane]], C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>6</sub> \u2013 two carbon and six hydrogen\n:[[propane]], C<sub>3</sub>H<sub>8</sub> \u2013 three carbon and 8 hydrogen\n:[[butane]], C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> \u2013 four carbon and 10 hydrogen\n:[[pentane]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> \u2013 five carbon and 12 hydrogen\n:[[hexane]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> \u2013 six carbon and 14 hydrogen\n\nThe first four names were [[back-formation|derived]] from [[methanol]], [[diethyl ether|ether]], [[propionic acid]] and [[butyric acid]], respectively ([[hexadecane]] is also sometimes referred to as cetane). Alkanes with five or more carbon atoms are named by adding the [[Affix|suffix]] '''-ane''' to the appropriate [[IUPAC numerical multiplier|numerical multiplier]] prefix<ref name = reusch-nom>{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Nomenclature \u2013 Alkanes | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomen1.htm}}</ref> with elision of any terminal vowel (''-a'' or ''-o'') from the basic numerical term. Hence, [[pentane]], C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>; [[hexane]], C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub>; [[heptane]], C<sub>7</sub>H<sub>16</sub>; [[octane]], C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>; etc. The prefix is generally Greek, however alkanes with a carbon atom count ending in nine, for example [[nonane]], use the [[Latin language|Latin]] prefix '''non-'''. For a more complete list, see [[List of alkanes]].\n\n===Branched alkanes===\n[[Image:Isopentane-numbered-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|[[Ball-and-stick model]] of [[isopentane]] (common name) or 2-methylbutane (IUPAC systematic name)]]\nSimple branched alkanes often have a common name using a prefix to distinguish them from linear alkanes, for example [[pentane|''n''-pentane]], [[isopentane]], and [[neopentane]].\n\nIUPAC naming conventions can be used to produce a systematic name.\n\nThe key steps in the naming of more complicated branched alkanes are as follows:<ref>{{cite web | author = William Reusch | work = Virtual Textbook of Organic Chemistry | title = Examples of the IUPAC Rules in Practice | url = http://www.cem.msu.edu/~reusch/VirtualText/nomexmp1.htm}}</ref>\n* Identify the longest continuous chain of carbon atoms\n* Name this longest root chain using standard naming rules\n* Name each side chain by changing the suffix of the name of the alkane from \"-ane\" to \"-yl\"\n* Number the root chain in order to give the lowest possible numbers for the side-chains{{clarify|date=December 2016}}{{cn|date=December 2016}}\n* Number and name the side chains before the name of the root chain\n* If there are multiple side chains of the same type, use prefixes such as \"di-\" and \"tri-\" to indicate it as such, and number each one.\n* Add side chain names in alphabetical (disregarding \"di-\" etc. prefixes) order in front of the name of the root chain\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+ Comparison of nomenclatures for three isomers of C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>\n|-\n!

Cycloalkanes are named as per their acyclic counterparts with respect to the number of carbon atoms in their backbones, e.g., [[cyclopentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>10</sub>) is a cycloalkane with 5 carbon atoms just like [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>), but they are joined up in a five-membered ring. In a similar manner, [[propane]] and [[cyclopropane]], [[butane]] and [[cyclobutane]], etc.\n\nSubstituted cycloalkanes are named similarly to substituted alkanes \u2014 the cycloalkane ring is stated, and the substituents are according to their position on the ring, with the numbering decided by the [[Cahn\u2013Ingold\u2013Prelog priority rules]].<ref name=reusch-nom/>\n\n===Trivial/common names===\nThe trivial (non-[[IUPAC nomenclature|systematic]]) name for alkanes is ''paraffins''. Together, alkanes are known as the ''paraffin series''. Trivial names for compounds are usually historical artifacts. They were coined before the development of systematic names, and have been retained due to familiar usage in industry. Cycloalkanes are also called naphthenes.\n\nIt is almost certain that the term ''paraffin'' stems from the petrochemical industry. Branched-chain alkanes are called ''isoparaffins''. The use of the term \"paraffin\" is a general term and often does not distinguish between pure compounds and mixtures of [[isomer]]s, i.e., compounds of the same [[chemical formula]], e.g., [[pentane]] and [[isopentane]].\n\n;Examples\nThe following trivial names are retained in the IUPAC system:\n* [[isobutane]] for 2-methylpropane\n* [[isopentane]] for 2-methylbutane\n* [[neopentane]] for 2,2-dimethylpropane.\n\n==Physical properties==\n\nAll alkanes are colourless and odourless.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised+organic+chemistry.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=17 February 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029192647/http://nsdl.niscair.res.in/bitstream/123456789/777/1/Revised%2Borganic%2Bchemistry.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref><ref name=\"s-anand\">{{cite web|url=http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110508081631/http://textbook.s-anand.net/ncert/class-11/chemistry/13-hydrocarbons |dead-url=yes |archive-date=8 May 2011 |title=13.

Stronger intermolecular van der Waals forces give rise to greater boiling points of alkanes.<ref name=m&b>{{cite book|title = Organic Chemistry |author1=R. T. Morrison |author2=R. N. Boyd | isbn = 0-13-643669-2 | publisher = Prentice Hall | location = New Jersey | edition = 6th|year = 1992}}</ref>\n\nThere are two determinants for the strength of the van der Waals forces:\n* the number of electrons surrounding the [[molecule]], which increases with the alkane's molecular weight\n* the surface area of the molecule\n\nUnder [[standard conditions]], from CH<sub>4</sub> to C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> alkanes are gaseous; from C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub> to C<sub>17</sub>H<sub>36</sub> they are liquids; and after C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>38</sub> they are solids. As the boiling point of alkanes is primarily determined by weight, it should not be a surprise that the boiling point has almost a linear relationship with the size ([[molecular weight]]) of the molecule. As a rule of thumb, the boiling point rises 20\u201330&nbsp;\u00b0C for each carbon added to the chain; this rule applies to other homologous series.<ref name = m&b/>\n\nA straight-chain alkane will have a boiling point higher than a branched-chain alkane due to the greater surface area in contact, thus the greater van der Waals forces, between adjacent molecules. For example, compare [[isobutane]] (2-methylpropane) and [[n-butane]] (butane), which boil at \u221212 and 0&nbsp;\u00b0C, and 2,2-dimethylbutane and 2,3-dimethylbutane which boil at 50 and 58&nbsp;\u00b0C, respectively.<ref name = m&b/> For the latter case, two molecules 2,3-dimethylbutane can \"lock\" into each other better than the cross-shaped 2,2-dimethylbutane, hence the greater van der Waals forces.\n\nOn the other hand, cycloalkanes tend to have higher boiling points than their linear counterparts due to the locked conformations of the molecules, which give a plane of intermolecular contact.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n===Melting points===\nThe [[melting point]]s of the alkanes follow a similar trend to [[boiling points]] for the same reason as outlined above. That is, (all other things being equal) the larger the molecule the higher the melting point. There is one significant difference between boiling points and melting points. Solids have more rigid and fixed structure than liquids. This rigid structure requires energy to break down. Thus the better put together solid structures will require more energy to break apart. For alkanes, this can be seen from the graph above (i.e., the blue line). The odd-numbered alkanes have a lower trend in melting points than even numbered alkanes. This is because even numbered alkanes pack well in the solid phase, forming a well-organized structure, which requires more energy to break apart. The odd-numbered alkanes pack less well and so the \"looser\" organized solid packing structure requires less energy to break apart.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Boese R, Weiss HC, Blaser D | title= The melting point alternation in the short-chain ''n''-alkanes: Single-crystal X-ray analyses of propane at 30&nbsp;K and of ''n''-butane to ''n''-nonane at 90&nbsp;K | journal= Angew Chem Int Ed | year=1999 | volume=38 | pages=988\u2013992 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1521-3773(19990401)38:7<988::AID-ANIE988>3.3.CO;2-S}}</ref>\n\nThe melting points of branched-chain alkanes can be either higher or lower than those of the corresponding straight-chain alkanes, again depending on the ability of the alkane in question to pack well in the solid phase: This is particularly true for [[isoalkanes]] (2-methyl isomers), which often have melting points higher than those of the linear analogues.\n\n===Conductivity and solubility===\nAlkanes do not conduct electricity, nor are they substantially [[Relative static permittivity|polarized]] by an [[electric field]]. For this reason, they do not form [[hydrogen bond]]s and are insoluble in polar solvents such as water. Since the hydrogen bonds between individual water molecules are aligned away from an alkane molecule, the coexistence of an alkane and water leads to an increase in molecular order (a reduction in [[entropy]]). As there is no significant bonding between water molecules and alkane molecules, the [[second law of thermodynamics]] suggests that this reduction in entropy should be minimized by minimizing the contact between alkane and water: Alkanes are said to be [[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] in that they repel water.\n\nTheir solubility in nonpolar solvents is relatively good, a property that is called [[lipophilicity]]. Different alkanes are, for example, miscible in all proportions among themselves.\n\nThe density of the alkanes usually increases with the number of carbon atoms but remains less than that of water. Hence, alkanes form the upper layer in an alkane\u2013water mixture.\n\n===Molecular geometry===<!-- This section is linked from [[Nylon]] -->\n[[Image:Ch4 hybridization.svg|thumb|right|sp<sup>3</sup>-hybridization in [[methane]].]]\nThe molecular structure of the alkanes directly affects their physical and chemical characteristics. It is derived from the [[electron configuration]] of [[carbon]], which has four [[valence electron]]s. The carbon atoms in alkanes are always [[Orbital hybridization|sp<sup>3</sup> hybridized]], that is to say that the valence electrons are said to be in four equivalent orbitals derived from the combination of the 2s orbital and the three 2p orbitals. These orbitals, which have identical energies, are arranged spatially in the form of a [[tetrahedron]], the angle of cos<sup>\u22121</sup>(\u2212{{sfrac|3}})&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;109.47\u00b0 between them.\n\n===Bond lengths and bond angles===\nAn alkane molecule has only C\u2013H and C\u2013C single bonds. The former result from the overlap of an sp<sup>3</sup> orbital of carbon with the 1s orbital of a hydrogen; the latter by the overlap of two sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals on different carbon atoms. The [[bond length]]s amount to 1.09&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;m for a C\u2013H bond and 1.54&nbsp;\u00d7&nbsp;10<sup>\u221210</sup>&nbsp;m for a C\u2013C bond.\n[[Image:Ch4-structure.png|thumb|right|The tetrahedral structure of methane.]]\n\nThe spatial arrangement of the bonds is similar to that of the four sp<sup>3</sup> orbitals\u2014they are tetrahedrally arranged, with an angle of 109.47\u00b0 between them. Structural formulae that represent the bonds as being at right angles to one another, while both common and useful, do not correspond with the reality.\n\n===Conformation===\n{{Main article|Alkane stereochemistry}}\n\nThe structural formula and the [[bond angle]]s are not usually sufficient to completely describe the geometry of a molecule. There is a further [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degree of freedom]] for each carbon\u2013carbon bond: the [[torsion angle]] between the atoms or groups bound to the atoms at each end of the bond. The spatial arrangement described by the torsion angles of the molecule is known as its [[conformational isomerism|conformation]].\n[[Image:Newman projection ethane.png|thumb|right|200px|Newman projections of the two conformations of ethane: eclipsed on the left, staggered on the right.]]\n[[Image:Ethane-rotamers-3D-balls.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ball-and-stick model]]s of the two rotamers of ethane]]\n\n[[Ethane]] forms the simplest case for studying the conformation of alkanes, as there is only one C\u2013C bond. If one looks down the axis of the C\u2013C bond, one will see the so-called [[Newman projection]]. The hydrogen atoms on both the front and rear carbon atoms have an angle of 120\u00b0 between them, resulting from the projection of the base of the tetrahedron onto a flat plane. However, the torsion angle between a given hydrogen atom attached to the front carbon and a given hydrogen atom attached to the rear carbon can vary freely between 0\u00b0 and 360\u00b0. This is a consequence of the free rotation about a carbon\u2013carbon single bond. Despite this apparent freedom, only two limiting conformations are important: [[eclipsed]] conformation and [[staggered conformation]].\n\nThe two conformations, also known as [[rotamer]]s, differ in energy: The staggered conformation is 12.6&nbsp;kJ/mol lower in energy (more stable) than the eclipsed conformation (the least stable).\n\nThis difference in energy between the two conformations, known as the [[torsion energy]], is low compared to the thermal energy of an ethane molecule at ambient temperature. There is constant rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The time taken for an ethane molecule to pass from one staggered conformation to the next, equivalent to the rotation of one CH<sub>3</sub> group by 120\u00b0 relative to the other, is of the order of 10<sup>\u221211</sup>&nbsp;seconds.\n\nThe case of [[higher alkanes]] is more complex but based on similar principles, with the antiperiplanar conformation always being the most favored around each carbon\u2013carbon bond. For this reason, alkanes are usually shown in a zigzag arrangement in diagrams or in models. The actual structure will always differ somewhat from these idealized forms, as the differences in energy between the conformations are small compared to the thermal energy of the molecules: Alkane molecules have no fixed structural form, whatever the models may suggest.\n\n===Spectroscopic properties===\nVirtually all organic compounds contain carbon\u2013carbon, and carbon\u2013hydrogen bonds, and so show some of the features of alkanes in their spectra. Alkanes are notable for having no other groups, and therefore for the ''absence'' of other characteristic spectroscopic features of a different functional group like [[Alcohol (chemistry)|\u2013OH]], [[Aldehyde|\u2013CHO]], [[Carboxylic acid|\u2013COOH]] etc.\n\n====Infrared spectroscopy====\nThe carbon\u2013hydrogen stretching mode gives a strong absorption between 2850 and 2960&nbsp;[[Wavenumber|cm<sup>\u22121</sup>]], while the carbon\u2013carbon stretching mode absorbs between 800 and 1300&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. The carbon\u2013hydrogen bending modes depend on the nature of the group: methyl groups show bands at 1450&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1375&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>, while methylene groups show bands at 1465&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup> and 1450&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>. Carbon chains with more than four carbon atoms show a weak absorption at around 725&nbsp;cm<sup>\u22121</sup>.\n\n====NMR spectroscopy====\nThe proton resonances of alkanes are usually found at [[chemical shift|''\u03b4''<sub>H</sub>]] = 0.5\u20131.5. The carbon-13 resonances depend on the number of hydrogen atoms attached to the carbon: ''\u03b4''<sub>C</sub> = 8\u201330 (primary, methyl, \u2013CH<sub>3</sub>), 15\u201355 (secondary, methylene, \u2013CH<sub>2</sub>\u2013), 20\u201360 (tertiary, methyne, C\u2013H) and quaternary. The carbon-13 resonance of quaternary carbon atoms is characteristically weak, due to the lack of [[nuclear Overhauser effect]] and the long [[relaxation time]], and can be missed in weak samples, or samples that have not been run for a sufficiently long time.\n\n====Mass spectrometry====\nAlkanes have a high [[ionization energy]], and the molecular ion is usually weak. The fragmentation pattern can be difficult to interpret, but, in the case of branched chain alkanes, the carbon chain is preferentially cleaved at tertiary or quaternary carbons due to the relative stability of the resulting [[free radical]]s. The fragment resulting from the loss of a single methyl group (''M''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;15) is often absent, and other fragments are often spaced by intervals of fourteen mass units, corresponding to sequential loss of CH<sub>2</sub> groups.\n\n==Chemical properties==\n\nAlkanes are only weakly reactive with ionic and other polar substances. The [[acid dissociation constant]] (pK<sub>a</sub>) values of all alkanes are above 60, hence they are practically inert to acids and bases (see: [[carbon acid]]s). This inertness is the source of the term ''paraffins'' (with the meaning here of \"lacking affinity\"). In [[crude oil]] the alkane molecules have remained chemically unchanged for millions of years.\n\nHowever redox reactions of alkanes, in particular with oxygen and the halogens, are possible as the carbon atoms are in a strongly reduced condition; in the case of methane, the lowest possible oxidation state for carbon (\u22124) is reached. Reaction with oxygen (''if'' present in sufficient quantity to satisfy the reaction [[stoichiometry]]) leads to combustion without any smoke, producing [[carbon dioxide]] and water. [[Free radical halogenation]] reactions occur with halogens, leading to the production of [[haloalkanes]]. In addition, alkanes have been shown to interact with, and bind to, certain transition metal complexes in [[carbon-hydrogen bond activation|C\u2013H bond activation]].\n\n[[Free radical]]s, molecules with unpaired electrons, play a large role in most reactions of alkanes, such as cracking and reformation where long-chain alkanes are converted into shorter-chain alkanes and straight-chain alkanes into branched-chain isomers.\n\nIn highly branched alkanes, the bond angle may differ significantly from the optimal value (109.5\u00b0) in order to allow the different groups sufficient space. This causes a tension in the molecule, known as [[steric hindrance]], and can substantially increase the reactivity.\n\n===Reactions with oxygen (combustion reaction)===\nAll alkanes react with [[oxygen]] in a [[combustion]] reaction, although they become increasingly difficult to ignite as the number of carbon atoms increases. The general equation for complete combustion is:\n:C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub> + ({{sfrac|3|2}}''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O + ''n''&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>\n:or C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub> + ({{sfrac|3''n'' + 1|2}})&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O + ''n''&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nIn the absence of sufficient oxygen, [[carbon monoxide]] or even [[soot]] can be formed, as shown below:\n\n:C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub> + (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&nbsp;[[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] \u2192 (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O + ''n''&nbsp;[[carbon monoxide|CO]]\n\n:C<sub>''n''</sub>H<sub>2''n''+2</sub> + ({{sfrac|2}}''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;{{sfrac|2}})&nbsp;[[oxygen|O<sub>2</sub>]] \u2192 (''n''&nbsp;+&nbsp;1)&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O + ''n''&nbsp;[[carbon|C]]\n\nFor example, [[methane]]:\n:2&nbsp;CH<sub>4</sub> + 3&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2&nbsp;CO + 4&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O\n:CH<sub>4</sub> + {{sfrac|3|2}}&nbsp;O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CO + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nSee the [[Standard enthalpy change of formation (data table)#Alkanes|alkane heat of formation table]] for detailed data.\nThe [[standard enthalpy change of combustion]], \u0394<sub>c</sub>''H''<sup><s>o</s></sup>, for alkanes increases by about 650&nbsp;kJ/mol per CH<sub>2</sub> group. Branched-chain alkanes have lower values of \u0394<sub>c</sub>''H''<sup><s>o</s></sup> than straight-chain alkanes of the same number of carbon atoms, and so can be seen to be somewhat more stable.\n\n=== Reactions with halogens ===\n{{Main article|Free radical halogenation}}\nAlkanes react with [[halogen]]s in a so-called ''free radical halogenation'' reaction. The hydrogen atoms of the alkane are progressively replaced by halogen atoms. [[Free radical]]s are the reactive species that participate in the reaction, which usually leads to a mixture of products. The reaction is highly [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]], and can lead to an explosion.\n\nThese reactions are an important industrial route to halogenated hydrocarbons. There are three steps:\n* '''Initiation''' the halogen radicals form by [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolysis]]. Usually, energy in the form of heat or light is required.\n* '''Chain reaction''' or '''Propagation''' then takes place\u2014the halogen radical abstracts a hydrogen from the alkane to give an alkyl radical. This reacts further.\n* '''Chain termination''' where the radicals recombine.\n\nExperiments have shown that all halogenation produces a mixture of all possible isomers, indicating that all hydrogen atoms are susceptible to reaction. The mixture produced, however, is not a statistical mixture: Secondary and tertiary hydrogen atoms are preferentially replaced due to the greater stability of secondary and tertiary free-radicals. An example can be seen in the monobromination of propane:<ref name = m&b/>\n[[Image:Monobromination of propane.png|500px|center|Monobromination of [[propane]]]]\n\n=== Cracking ===\n{{Main article|Cracking (chemistry)}}\nCracking breaks larger molecules into smaller ones. This can be done with a thermal or catalytic method. The thermal cracking process follows a [[homolysis (chemistry)|homolytic]] mechanism with formation of [[free-radical]]s. The catalytic cracking process involves the presence of [[acid]] [[catalyst]]s (usually solid acids such as [[silica-alumina]] and [[zeolite]]s), which promote a [[heterolytic cleavage|heterolytic]] (asymmetric) breakage of bonds yielding pairs of ions of opposite charges, usually a [[carbocation]] and the very unstable [[hydride]] [[anion]]. Carbon-localized free radicals and cations are both highly unstable and undergo processes of chain rearrangement, C\u2013C scission in position [[beta scission|beta]] (i.e., cracking) and [[intramolecular|intra-]] and [[intermolecular]] hydrogen transfer or [[hydride]] transfer. In both types of processes, the corresponding [[reactive intermediate]]s (radicals, ions) are permanently regenerated, and thus they proceed by a self-propagating chain mechanism. The chain of reactions is eventually terminated by radical or ion recombination.\n\n=== Isomerization and reformation ===\nDragan and his colleague were the first to report about isomerization in alkanes.<ref name=\"Asinger, Friedrich 1967\">Asinger, Friedrich. Paraffins; Chemistry and Technology. Oxford: Pergamon Press, 1967. Print.</ref>  Isomerization and reformation are processes in which straight-chain alkanes are heated in the presence of a [[platinum]] catalyst. In isomerization, the alkanes become branched-chain isomers. In other words, it does not lose any carbons or hydrogens, keeping the same molecular weight.<ref name=\"Asinger, Friedrich 1967\"/> In reformation, the alkanes become [[cycloalkane]]s or [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, giving off hydrogen as a by-product. Both of these processes raise the [[octane number]] of the substance. Butane is the most common alkane that is put under the process of isomerization, as it makes many branched alkanes with high octane numbers.<ref name=\"Asinger, Friedrich 1967\"/>\n\n===Other reactions===\nAlkanes will react with [[steam]] in the presence of a [[nickel]] [[catalyst]] to give [[hydrogen]]. Alkanes can be [[Chlorosulfonation|chlorosulfonated]] and [[nitration|nitrated]], although both reactions require special conditions. The [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] of alkanes to [[carboxylic acid]]s is of some technical importance. In the [[Reed reaction]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[chlorine]] and [[photochemistry|light]] convert hydrocarbons to [[Sulfonic acid|sulfonyl chlorides]]. [[Nucleophilic abstraction|Nucleophilic Abstraction]] can be used to separate an alkane from a metal. Alkyl groups can be transferred from one compound to another by [[transmetalation]] reactions.\n\n==Occurrence==\n{{refimprove|date=July 2015}}\n\n===Occurrence of alkanes in the Universe===\n[[Image:Jupiter.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methane]] and [[ethane]] make up a tiny proportion<!-- 0.3% methane and 0.00006% ethane is tiny not large --> of [[Jupiter]]'s atmosphere]]\n[[Image:Oil well.jpg|thumb|right|Extraction of oil, which contains many different [[hydrocarbon]]s including alkanes]]\n\nAlkanes form a small portion<!-- 0.3% methane and 0.00006% ethane for Jupiter is small not significant: else find cite that claims this is significant, or specify in which context.

These hydrocarbons were formed when marine animals and plants (zooplankton and phytoplankton) died and sank to the bottom of ancient seas and were covered with sediments in an [[wikt:anoxic|anoxic]] environment and converted over many millions of years at high temperatures and high pressure to their current form. Natural gas resulted thereby for example from the following reaction:\n:C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> \u2192 3&nbsp;CH<sub>4</sub> + 3&nbsp;CO<sub>2</sub>\n\nThese hydrocarbon deposits, collected in porous rocks trapped beneath impermeable cap rocks, comprise commercial [[oil fields]]. They have formed over millions of years and once exhausted cannot be readily replaced. The depletion of these hydrocarbons reserves is the basis for what is known as the [[energy crisis]].\n\nMethane is also present in what is called [[biogas]], produced by animals and decaying matter, which is a possible [[renewable energy source]].\n\nAlkanes have a low solubility in water, so the content in the oceans is negligible; however, at high pressures and low temperatures (such as at the bottom of the oceans), methane can co-crystallize with water to form a solid [[methane clathrate]] (methane hydrate). Although this cannot be commercially exploited at the present time, the amount of combustible energy of the known methane clathrate fields exceeds the energy content of all the natural gas and oil deposits put together. Methane extracted from methane clathrate is, therefore, a candidate for future fuels.\n\n===Biological occurrence===\nAcyclic alkanes occur in nature in various ways.\n\n;Bacteria and archaea\n[[Image:Rotbuntes Rind.jpg|thumb|right|[[Methanogen]]ic [[archaea]] in the gut of this cow are responsible for some of the [[methane]] in Earth's atmosphere.]]\nCertain types of bacteria can metabolize alkanes: they prefer even-numbered carbon chains as they are easier to degrade than odd-numbered chains.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nOn the other hand, certain [[archaea]], the [[methanogen]]s, produce large quantities of [[methane]] by the metabolism of [[carbon dioxide]] or other [[oxidation|oxidized]] organic compounds. The energy is released by the oxidation of [[hydrogen]]:\n:CO<sub>2</sub> + 4&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 CH<sub>4</sub> + 2&nbsp;H<sub>2</sub>O\n\nMethanogens are also the producers of [[marsh gas]] in [[wetlands]], and release about two billion tonnes of methane per year{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\u2014the atmospheric content of this gas is produced nearly exclusively by them. The methane output of [[cattle]] and other [[herbivore]]s, which can release up to 150 liters per day,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} and of [[termite]]s,{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} is also due to methanogens. They also produce this simplest of all alkanes in the [[intestine]]s of humans. Methanogenic archaea are, hence, at the end of the [[carbon cycle]], with carbon being released back into the atmosphere after having been fixed by [[photosynthesis]]. It is probable that our current deposits of natural gas were formed in a similar way.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\n;Fungi and plants\nAlkanes also play a role, if a minor role, in the biology of the three [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] groups of organisms: [[Fungus|fungi]], plants and animals. Some specialized yeasts, e.g., ''Candida tropicale'', ''[[Pichia]]'' sp., ''[[Rhodotorula]]'' sp., can use alkanes as a source of carbon or energy. The fungus ''[[Amorphotheca resinae]]'' prefers the longer-chain alkanes in [[aviation fuel]], and can cause serious problems for aircraft in tropical regions.<ref name=Hendey>{{cite journal | last1 = Hendey | first1 = N.

With others like the [[tsetse fly]] ''Glossina morsitans morsitans'', the pheromone contains the four alkanes 2-methylheptadecane (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>38</sub>), 17,21-dimethylheptatriacontane (C<sub>39</sub>H<sub>80</sub>), 15,19-dimethylheptatriacontane (C<sub>39</sub>H<sub>80</sub>) and 15,19,23-trimethylheptatriacontane (C<sub>40</sub>H<sub>82</sub>), and acts by smell over longer distances. [[waggle dance|Waggle-dancing]] [[honey bee]]s produce and release two alkanes, tricosane and pentacosane.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Thom | date = 21 August 2007 | title = The Scent of the Waggle Dance | url = | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 5 | issue = 9| page = e228 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0050228 | pmid=17713987 | pmc=1994260|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\n===Ecological relations===\n[[Image:Ophrys sphegodes flower.jpg|thumb|right|Early spider orchid (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]'')]]\nOne example, in which both plant and animal alkanes play a role, is the ecological relationship between the [[sand bee]] (''[[Andrena nigroaenea]]'') and the [[early spider orchid]] (''[[Ophrys sphegodes]]''); the latter is dependent for [[pollination]] on the former. Sand bees use pheromones in order to identify a mate; in the case of ''A. nigroaenea'', the females emit a mixture of [[tricosane]] (C<sub>23</sub>H<sub>48</sub>), [[pentacosane]] (C<sub>25</sub>H<sub>52</sub>) and [[heptacosane]] (C<sub>27</sub>H<sub>56</sub>) in the ratio 3:3:1, and males are attracted by specifically this odor. The orchid takes advantage of this mating arrangement to get the male bee to collect and disseminate its pollen; parts of its flower not only resemble the appearance of sand bees but also produce large quantities of the three alkanes in the same ratio as female sand bees. As a result, numerous males are lured to the blooms and attempt to copulate with their imaginary partner: although this endeavor is not crowned with success for the bee, it allows the orchid to transfer its pollen,\nwhich will be dispersed after the departure of the frustrated male to different blooms.\n\n==Production==\n\n===Petroleum refining===\n[[Image:ShellMartinez-refi.jpg|thumb|right|An [[oil refinery]] at [[Martinez, California]].]]\nAs stated earlier, the most important source of alkanes is natural gas and [[crude oil]].<ref name=m&b/> Alkanes are separated in an [[oil refinery]] by [[fractional distillation]] and processed into many different products.\n\n===Fischer\u2013Tropsch===\nThe [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch process]] is a method to synthesize liquid hydrocarbons, including alkanes, from [[carbon monoxide]] and hydrogen. This method is used to produce substitutes for [[petroleum distillate]]s.\n\n===Laboratory preparation===\nThere is usually little need for alkanes to be synthesized in the laboratory, since they are usually commercially available. Also, alkanes are generally unreactive chemically or biologically, and do not undergo [[functional group interconversion]]s cleanly. When alkanes are produced in the laboratory, it is often a side-product of a reaction. For example, the use of [[N-Butyllithium|''n''-butyllithium]] as a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] gives the conjugate acid, ''n''-butane as a side-product:\n\n: C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>9</sub>Li + H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub> + [[lithium hydroxide|LiOH]]\n\nHowever, at times it may be desirable to make a section of a molecule into an alkane-like functionality ([[alkyl]] group) using the above or similar methods. For example, an [[ethyl group]] is an alkyl group; when this is attached to a [[Hydroxyl|hydroxy]] group, it gives [[ethanol]], which is not an alkane. To do so, the best-known methods are [[hydrogenation]] of [[alkene]]s:\n\n:RCH=CH<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub> \u2192 RCH<sub>2</sub>CH<sub>3</sub>{{spaces|5}}(R = [[alkyl]])\n\nAlkanes or alkyl groups can also be prepared directly from [[alkyl halide]]s in the [[Corey\u2013House synthesis|Corey\u2013House\u2013Posner\u2013Whitesides reaction]].

The first four alkanes are used mainly for heating and cooking purposes, and in some countries for electricity generation. [[Methane]] and [[ethane]] are the main components of natural gas; they are normally stored as gases under pressure. It is, however, easier to transport them as liquids: This requires both compression and cooling of the gas.\n\n[[Propane]] and [[butane]] are gases at atmospheric pressure that can be liquefied at fairly low pressures and are commonly known as [[liquified petroleum gas]] (LPG). Propane is used in propane gas burners and as a fuel for road vehicles,<ref>[http://www.ferrellgas.com/Resource_/PageResource/LA_Transit_Case_Study.pdf Using propane as a fuel]</ref> butane in space heaters and disposable cigarette lighters. Both are used as propellants in [[aerosol spray]]s.\n\nFrom [[pentane]] to [[octane]] the alkanes are highly volatile liquids. They are used as fuels in [[internal combustion engine]]s, as they vaporize easily on entry into the combustion chamber without forming droplets, which would impair the uniformity of the combustion. Branched-chain alkanes are preferred as they are much less prone to premature ignition, which causes [[Engine knocking|knocking]], than their straight-chain homologues. This propensity to premature ignition is measured by the [[octane rating]] of the fuel, where [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (''isooctane'') has an arbitrary value of 100, and [[heptane]] has a value of zero. Apart from their use as fuels, the middle alkanes are also good [[solvent]]s for nonpolar substances.\n\nAlkanes from [[nonane]] to, for instance, [[hexadecane]] (an alkane with sixteen carbon atoms) are liquids of higher [[viscosity]], less and less suitable for use in gasoline. They form instead the major part of [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] and [[aviation fuel]]. Diesel fuels are characterized by their [[cetane number]], cetane being an old name for hexadecane. However, the higher melting points of these alkanes can cause problems at low temperatures and in polar regions, where the fuel becomes too thick to flow correctly.\n\nAlkanes from hexadecane upwards form the most important components of [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. In the latter function, they work at the same time as anti-corrosive agents, as their hydrophobic nature means that water cannot reach the metal surface. Many solid alkanes find use as [[paraffin wax]], for example, in [[candle]]s. This should not be confused however with true [[wax]], which consists primarily of [[ester]]s.\n\nAlkanes with a chain length of approximately 35 or more carbon atoms are found in [[bitumen]], used, for example, in road surfacing. However, the higher alkanes have little value and are usually split into lower alkanes by [[Cracking (chemistry)|cracking]].\n\nSome synthetic [[polymer]]s such as [[polyethylene]] and [[polypropylene]] are alkanes with chains containing hundreds of thousands of carbon atoms. These materials are used in innumerable applications, and billions of kilograms of these materials are made and used each year.\n\n==Environmental transformations==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\n}}\nAlkanes are chemically very inert apolar molecules which are not very reactive as organic compounds.  This inertness yields serious ecological issues if they are released into the environment. Due to their lack of functional groups and low water solubility alkanes show poor bioavailability for microorganisms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226738847_Microbial_Degradation_of_Alkanes|title=Microbial Degradation of Alkanes (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-02-23}}</ref>\n\nThere are however some microorganisms possessing the metabolic capacity to utilize n-alkanes as both carbon and energy sources.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Berthe-Corti|first=L.|last2=Fetzner|first2=S.|date=2002-07-01|title=Bacterial Metabolism of n-Alkanes and Ammonia under Oxic, Suboxic and Anoxic Conditions|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1521-3846(200207)22:3/43.0.CO;2-F/abstract|journal=Acta Biotechnologica|language=en|volume=22|issue=3-4|pages=299\u2013336|doi=10.1002/1521-3846(200207)22:3/43.0.CO;2-F|issn=1521-3846}}</ref> Some bacterial species are highly specialised in degrading alkanes, these are referred to as hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. \n\n==Hazards==\n{{multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2014}}\n{{expand section|date=August 2014}}\n}}\nMethane is explosive when mixed with air (1\u20138% CH<sub>4</sub>) and other lower alkanes can also form explosive mixtures with air.

Court of Appeals.JPG|thumb|The [[District of Columbia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]]]\n'''United States appellate procedure''' involves the rules and regulations for filing [[appeal]]s in [[state court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. The nature of an appeal can vary greatly depending on the type of case and the rules of the court in the [[jurisdiction]] where the case was prosecuted. There are many types of [[standard of review]] for appeals, such as ''[[Trial de novo|de novo]]'' and [[abuse of discretion]]. However, most appeals begin when a party files a [[petition for review]] to a higher court for the purpose of overturning the lower court's decision.\n\nAn [[appellate court]] is a [[court]] that hears cases on appeal from another court. Depending on the particular legal rules that apply to each circumstance, a party to a [[court case]] who is unhappy with the result might be able to challenge that result in an appellate court on specific grounds. These grounds typically could include errors of law, [[fact]], procedure or due process. In different jurisdictions, appellate courts are also called appeals courts, courts of appeals, superior courts, or supreme courts.\n\nThe specific procedures for appealing, including even whether there is a right of appeal from a particular type of decision, can vary greatly from state to state. The right to file an appeal can also vary from state to state; for example, the [[New Jersey Constitution]] vests judicial power in a Supreme Court, a Superior Court, and other courts of limited jurisdiction, with an appellate court being part of the Superior Court.<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 1:2</ref>\n\n==Access to appellant status==\nA party who files an appeal is called an \"appellant\", \"plaintiff in error\", \"petitioner\" or \"pursuer\", and a party on the other side is called a \"appellee\". A \"cross-appeal\" is an appeal brought by the respondent. For example, suppose at trial the judge found for the plaintiff and ordered the defendant to pay $50,000. If the defendant files an appeal arguing that he should not have to pay any money, then the plaintiff might file a cross-appeal arguing that the defendant should have to pay $200,000 instead of $50,000.\n\nThe appellant is the party who, having lost part or all their [[lawsuit|claim]] in a [[lower court]] decision, is appealing to a higher court to have their case reconsidered. This is usually done on the basis that the lower court judge erred in the application of law, but it may also be possible to appeal on the basis of court misconduct, or that a finding of fact was entirely unreasonable to make on the evidence.\n\nThe appellant in the new case can be either the [[plaintiff]] (or claimant), [[defendant]], third-party [[intervenor]], or respondent (appellee) from the lower case, depending on who was the losing party. The winning party from the lower court, however, is now the respondent. In unusual cases the appellant can be the victor in the court below, but still appeal.\n\nAn appellee is the party to an appeal in which the lower court [[judgment (law)|judgment]] was in its favor. The appellee is required to respond to the [[petition]], [[oral argument]]s, and [[legal brief]]s of the appellant. In general, the appellee takes the procedural posture that the lower court's decision should be affirmed.\n\n==Ability to appeal==\nAn appeal \"as of right\" is one that is guaranteed by statute or some underlying constitutional or legal principle.  The appellate court cannot refuse to listen to the appeal.  An appeal \"by leave\" or \"permission\" requires the appellant to obtain leave to appeal; in such a situation either or both of the lower court and the court may have the discretion to grant or refuse the appellant's demand to appeal the lower court's decision. In the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]], review in most cases is available only if the Court exercises its discretion and grants a writ of certiorari.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/10.html|title=U.S. Supreme Court Rule 10|publisher=Legal Information Institute}}</ref>\n\nIn [[tort]], [[equity (law)|equity]], or other civil matters either party to a previous case may file an appeal.  In criminal matters, however, the state or prosecution generally has no appeal \"as of right\".  And due to the [[double jeopardy]] principle, the state or prosecution may never appeal a jury or bench verdict of acquittal.  But in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal \"as of right\" from a trial court's dismissal of an indictment in whole or in part or from a trial court's granting of a defendant's suppression motion.  Likewise, in some jurisdictions, the state or prosecution may appeal an issue of law \"by leave\" from the trial court or the appellate court.  The ability of the prosecution to appeal a decision in favor of a defendant varies significantly internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |title=Consultation Paper on Prosecution Appeals Brought in Cases of Indictment |publisher=Law Reform Commission of Ireland |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071119043436/http://www.lawreform.ie/publications/data/lrc119/lrc_119.html |archivedate=November 19, 2007 }}</ref> All parties must present grounds to appeal, or it will not be heard.\n\nBy convention in some law reports, the appellant is named first.  This can mean that where it is the defendant who appeals, the name of the case in the law reports reverses (in some cases twice) as the appeals work their way up the court hierarchy. This is not always true, however.  In the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], the parties' names always stay in the same order as the lower court when an appeal is taken to the [[United States Courts of Appeals|circuit courts of appeals]], and are re-ordered only if the appeal reaches the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==Direct or collateral: Appealing criminal convictions==\nMany jurisdictions recognize two types of appeals, particularly in the criminal context.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/law/hamlyn/postconv.htm|title=UK Law Online |publisher=University of Leeds }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |title=Special Habeas Corpus Procedures in Capital Cases |publisher=United States Office of the Law Revision Counsel |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228011124/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/28C154.txt |archivedate=February 28, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-03 |url=http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |title=State of Ohio |publisher=Ohio 12th District Court of Appeals |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080227072142/http://www.twelfth.courts.state.oh.us/Decisions/Pre00011.doc |archivedate=February 27, 2008 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}</ref> The first is the traditional \"direct\" appeal in which the appellant files an appeal with the next higher court of review.  The second is the collateral appeal or post-conviction petition, in which the petitioner-appellant files the appeal in a court of first instance\u2014usually the court that tried the case.\n\nThe key distinguishing factor between direct and collateral appeals is that the former occurs in state courts, and the latter in federal courts.{{dubious|Non-federal collateral review|date=May 2017}}\n\nRelief in post-conviction is rare and is most often found in [[capital punishment|capital]] or violent [[felony]] cases.  The typical scenario involves an incarcerated defendant locating [[DNA]] evidence demonstrating the defendant's actual innocence.\n\n===Appellate review===\n\"Appellate review\" is the general term for the process by which courts with appellate [[jurisdiction]] take jurisdiction of matters decided by lower courts. It is distinguished from [[Judicial review (theory)|judicial review]], which refers to the court's overriding constitutional or statutory right to determine if a legislative act or administrative decision is defective for jurisdictional or other reasons (which may vary by jurisdiction).\n\nIn most jurisdictions the normal and preferred way of seeking appellate review is by filing an appeal of the final [[Legal judgment|judgment]]. Generally, an appeal of the judgment will also allow appeal of all other orders or rulings made by the trial court in the course of the case.  This is because such orders cannot be appealed \"as of right\". However, certain critical interlocutory [[court order]]s, such as the denial of a request for an interim [[injunction]], or an order holding a person in [[contempt of court]], can be appealed immediately although the case may otherwise not have been fully disposed of.\n\nThere are two distinct forms of appellate review, \"direct\" and \"collateral\". For example, a criminal defendant may be convicted in state court, and lose on \"direct appeal\" to higher state appellate courts, and if unsuccessful, mount a \"collateral\" action such as filing for a writ of [[habeas corpus]] in the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]]. Generally speaking, \"[d]irect appeal statutes afford defendants the opportunity to challenge the merits of a judgment and allege errors of law or fact. ... [Collateral review], on the other hand, provide[s] an independent and civil inquiry into the validity of a conviction and sentence, and as such are generally limited to challenges to constitutional, jurisdictional, or other fundamental violations that occurred at trial.\" \"Graham v. Borgen\", 483 F 3d. 475 (7th Cir. 2007) (no. 04-4103) (slip op. at 7) (citation omitted).\n\nIn Anglo-American [[common law]] courts, appellate review of lower court decisions may also be obtained by filing a petition for review by [[prerogative writ]] in certain cases.  There is no corresponding right to a writ in any pure or continental [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] legal systems, though some mixed systems such as [[Civil Code of Quebec|Quebec]] recognize these prerogative writs.\n\n====Direct Appeal====\nAfter exhausting the first appeal as of right, defendants usually petition the highest state court to review the decision. This appeal is known as a direct appeal.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bickford|first=James|title=Opinion Recap:All Judicial Review is either direct or collateral|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2011/03/opinion-summary-all-judicial-review-is-either-direct-or-collateral/|work=Anti-Terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act|publisher=SCOTUS Bblog|accessdate=2011-05-04}}</ref> The highest state court, generally known as the Supreme Court, exercises discretion over whether it will review the case. On direct appeal, a prisoner challenges the grounds of the conviction based on an error that occurred at trial or some other stage in the adjudicative process.\n\n=====Preservation Issues=====\nAn appellant's claim(s) must usually be preserved at trial. This means that the defendant had to object to the error when it occurred in the trial. Because constitutional claims are of great magnitude, appellate courts might be more lenient to review the claim even if it was not preserved. For example, Connecticut applies the following standard to review unpreserved claims: 1.the record is adequate to review the alleged claim of error; 2. the claim is of constitutional magnitude alleging the violation of a fundamental right; 3. the alleged constitutional violation clearly exists and clearly deprived the defendant of a fair trial; 4. if subject to harmless error analysis, the state has failed to demonstrate harmlessness of the alleged constitutional violation beyond a reasonable doubt.<ref>{{cite web|last=Dauman|first=Chad|title=Criminal Appeals in the United States: Preservation Issues|url=http://www.Chaddauman.blogspot.com|work=blog|accessdate=2011-04-27}}</ref>\n\n====State Post Conviction Relief: Collateral Appeal====\nAll States have a post-conviction relief process.  Similar to federal post-conviction relief, an appellant can petition the court to correct alleged fundamental errors that were not corrected on direct review.<ref>{{cite book|last=Yackle|first=Larry|title=Federal Courts, Habeas Corpus|year=2003|publisher=Thomson Reuters}}</ref>  Typical claims might include [[ineffective assistance of counsel]] and actual innocence based on new evidence. These proceedings are normally separate from the direct appeal, however some states allow for collateral relief to be sought on direct appeal.<ref>[http://courts.mi.gov/Courts/MichiganSupremeCourt/rules/Documents/CHAPTER%207.%20APPELLATE%20RULES%20(entire%20chapter).pdf]</ref> After direct appeal, the conviction is considered final. An appeal from the post conviction court proceeds just as a direct appeal. That is, it goes to the intermediate appellate court, followed by the highest court. If the petition is granted the appellant could be released from incarceration, the sentence could be modified, or a new trial could be ordered.<ref>{{cite web|title=Process For Post-Conviction Relief|url=http://www.doj.state.or.us/victims/pdf/pcvap_handout_post_conviction.pdf|work=Oregon Department of Justice|publisher=Oregon Department of Justice|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====Habeas Corpus====\n{{main|Habeas corpus in the United States}}\n\n==Notice of appeal==\nA \"notice of appeal\" is a form or document that in many cases is required to begin an appeal. The form is completed by the appellant or by the appellant's legal representative. The nature of this form can vary greatly from country to country and from court to court within a country.\n\nThe specific rules of the legal system will dictate exactly how the appeal is officially begun. For example, the appellant might have to file the notice of appeal with the appellate court, or with the court from which the appeal is taken, or both.\n\nSome courts have samples of a notice of appeal on the court's own web site.  In New Jersey, for example, the Administrative Office of the Court has promulgated a form of notice of appeal for use by appellants, though using this exact form is not mandatory and the failure to use it is not a jurisdictional defect provided that all pertinent information is set forth in whatever form of notice of appeal is used.<ref>Jeffrey S. Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books)</ref>\n\nThe deadline for beginning an appeal can often be very short: traditionally, it is measured in days, not months. This can vary from country to country, as well as within a country, depending on the specific rules in force. In the U.S. federal court system, criminal defendants must file a notice of appeal within 10 days of the entry of either the judgment or the order being appealed, or the right to appeal is forfeited.<ref>{{citation|title=Rule 4(b)(1)(A)|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode28a/usc_sec_28a_00000004----000-.html}}</ref>\n\n==Appellate procedure==\n{{See also|United States courts of appeals}}\nGenerally speaking the appellate court examines the record of [[evidence (law)|evidence]] presented in the trial court and the law that the lower court applied and decides whether that decision was legally sound or not.  The appellate court will typically be deferential to the lower court's findings of fact (such as whether a defendant committed a particular act), unless clearly erroneous, and so will focus on the court's application of the law to those facts (such as whether the act found by the court to have occurred fits a legal definition at issue).\n\nIf the appellate court finds no defect, it \"affirms\" the judgment.  If the appellate court does find a legal defect in the decision \"below\" (i.e., in the lower court), it may \"modify\" the ruling to correct the defect, or it may nullify (\"reverse\" or \"vacate\") the whole decision or any part of it.  It may, in addition, send the case back (\"remand\" or \"remit\") to the lower court for further proceedings to remedy the defect.\n\nIn some cases, an appellate court may review a lower court decision \"de novo\" (or completely), challenging even the lower court's findings of fact.  This might be the proper standard of review, for example, if the lower court resolved the case by granting a pre-trial [[motion to dismiss]] or motion for [[summary judgment]] which is usually based only upon written submissions to the trial court and not on any trial testimony.\n\nAnother situation is where appeal is by way of \"re-hearing\". Certain jurisdictions permit certain appeals to cause the trial to be heard afresh in the appellate court.\n\nSometimes, the appellate court finds a defect in the procedure the parties used in filing the appeal and dismisses the appeal without considering its merits, which has the same effect as affirming the judgment below.  (This would happen, for example, if the appellant waited too long, under the appellate court's rules, to file the appeal.)\n\nGenerally, there is no [[Jury trial|trial]] in an appellate court, only consideration of the record of the evidence presented to the trial court and all the pre-trial and trial court proceedings are reviewed\u2014unless the appeal is by way of re-hearing, new evidence will usually only be considered on appeal in \"very\" rare instances, for example if that material evidence was unavailable to a party for some very significant reason such as [[prosecutorial misconduct]].\n\nIn some systems, an appellate court will only consider the written decision of the lower court, together with any written evidence that was before that court and is relevant to the appeal. In other systems, the appellate court will normally consider the record of the lower court. In those cases the record will first be certified by the lower court.\n\nThe appellant has the opportunity to present arguments for the granting of the appeal and the appellee (or respondent) can present arguments against it.  Arguments of the parties to the appeal are presented through their appellate lawyers, if represented, or \"[[pro se]]\" if the party has not engaged legal representation.  Those arguments are presented in written [[brief (law)|briefs]] and sometimes in [[oral argument]] to the court at a [[hearing (law)|hearing]]. At such hearings each party is allowed a brief presentation at which the appellate judges ask questions based on their review of the record below and the submitted briefs.\n\nIn an [[adversarial system]], appellate courts do not have the power to review lower court decisions unless a party appeals it. Therefore, if a lower court has ruled in an improper manner, or against [[Precedent|legal precedent]], that judgment will stand if not appealed \u2013 even if it might have been overturned on appeal.\n\nThe United States legal system generally recognizes two types of appeals: a trial \"de novo\" or an appeal on the record.\n\nA [[trial de novo]] is usually available for review of informal proceedings conducted by some minor judicial tribunals in proceedings that do not provide all the procedural attributes of a formal judicial [[trial (law)|trial]].  If unchallenged, these decisions have the power to settle more minor legal disputes once and for all.  If a party is dissatisfied with the finding of such a tribunal, one generally has the power to request a trial \"de novo\" by a [[court of record]].  In such a proceeding, all issues and [[evidence (law)|evidence]] may be developed newly, as though never heard before, and one is not restricted to the evidence heard in the lower proceeding.  Sometimes, however, the decision of the lower proceeding is itself admissible as evidence, thus helping to curb frivolous appeals.\n\nIn some cases, an application for \"trial de novo\" effectively erases the prior trial as if it had never taken place.  The Supreme Court of Virginia has stated that '\"This Court has repeatedly held that the effect of an appeal to circuit court is to \"annul the judgment of the inferior tribunal as completely as if there had been no previous trial.\"'<ref>\"Gaskill v. Commonwealth\", 206 Va. 486, 490, 144 S.E.2d 293, 296 (1965)</ref>  The only exception to this is that if a defendant appeals a conviction for a crime having multiple levels of offenses, where they are convicted on a lesser offense, the appeal is of the lesser offense; the conviction represents an acquittal of the more serious offenses. \"[A] trial on the same charges in the circuit court does not violate double jeopardy principles, . . . subject only to the limitation that conviction in [the] district court for an offense lesser included in the one charged constitutes an acquittal of the greater offense,\npermitting trial de novo in the circuit court only for the lesser-included offense.\"<ref>\"Kenyon v. Commonwealth\", 37 Va. App. 668, 673, 561 S.E.2d 17, 19\u201320</ref>\n\nIn an appeal on the record from a decision in a judicial proceeding, both appellant and respondent are bound to base their arguments wholly on the proceedings and body of evidence as they were presented in the lower tribunal.  Each seeks to prove to the higher court that the result they desired was the just result.  [[Precedent]] and [[case law]] figure prominently in the arguments.  In order for the appeal to succeed, the appellant must prove that the lower court committed [[reversible error]], that is, an impermissible action by the court acted to cause a result that was unjust, and which would not have resulted had the court acted properly.  Some examples of reversible error would be erroneously instructing the jury on the law applicable to the case, permitting seriously [[improper argument]] by an attorney, admitting or excluding evidence improperly, acting outside the court's jurisdiction, injecting bias into the proceeding or appearing to do so, juror misconduct, etc.  The failure to formally object at the time, to what one views as improper action in the lower court, may result in the affirmance of the lower court's judgment on the grounds that one did not \"preserve the issue for appeal\" by objecting.\n\nIn cases where a judge rather than a jury decided issues of fact, an appellate court will apply an \"abuse of discretion\" standard of review. Under this standard, the appellate court gives deference to the lower court's view of the evidence, and reverses its decision only if it were a clear abuse of discretion. This is usually defined as a decision outside the bounds of reasonableness.  On the other hand, the appellate court normally gives less deference to a lower court's decision on issues of law, and may reverse if it finds that the lower court applied the wrong legal standard.\n\nIn some cases, an appellant may successfully argue that the law under which the lower decision was rendered was [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] or otherwise invalid, or may convince the higher court to order a new trial on the basis that evidence earlier sought was concealed or only recently discovered.  In the case of new evidence, there must be a high probability that its presence or absence would have made a material difference in the trial.  Another issue suitable for appeal in criminal cases is effective assistance of counsel. If a defendant has been convicted and can prove that his lawyer did not adequately handle his case and that there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different had the lawyer given competent representation, he is entitled to a new trial.\n\nA lawyer traditionally starts an oral argument to any appellate court with the words \"May it please the court.\"\n\nAfter an appeal is heard, the \"mandate\" is a formal notice of a decision by a court of appeal; this notice is transmitted to the trial court and, when filed by the [[Court clerk|clerk]] of the trial court, constitutes the final judgment on the case, unless the appeal court has directed further proceedings in the trial court. The mandate is distinguished from the appeal court's [[court opinion|opinion]], which sets out the legal reasoning for its decision. In some jurisdictions the mandate is known as the \"remittitur\".\n\n==Results==\nThe result of an appeal can be:\n:*<span id=\"Affirmed\">Affirmed</span>: Where the reviewing court basically agrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s). \n:*<span id=\"Reversed\">Reversed</span>: Where the reviewing court basically disagrees with the result of the lower courts ruling(s), and overturns their decision.\n:*<span id=\"Remanded\">Remanded</span>: Where the reviewing court sends the case back to the lower court.\n\nThere can be multiple outcomes, so that the reviewing court can affirm some rulings, reverse others and remand the case all at the same time. Remand is not required where there is nothing left to do in the case.  \"Generally speaking, an appellate court's judgment provides 'the final directive of the appeals courts as to the matter appealed, setting out with specificity the court's determination that the action appealed from should be affirmed, reversed, remanded or modified'\".<ref>State v. Randolph, 210 N.J. 330, 350 n.5 (2012), citing Mandel, New Jersey Appellate Practice (Gann Law Books), chapter 28:2</ref>\n\nSome reviewing courts who have discretionary review may send a case back without comment other than ''review improvidently granted''. In other words, after looking at the case, they chose not to say anything.  The result for the case of ''review improvidently granted'' is effectively the same as affirmed, but without that extra higher court stamp of approval.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{wikiquote}}\n{{wiktionary|appeal}}\n* [[Appellate court]]\n* [[Appellee]]\n* [[Civil procedure]]\n* [[Court of Appeals (disambiguation)|Court of Appeals]]\n* [[Courts-martial in the United States]]\n* [[Criminal procedure]]\n* [[Defendant]]\n* [[Interlocutory appeal]]\n* [[List of legal topics]]\n* [[Petition for stay]]\n* [[Plaintiff]]\n* [[Pursuer]]\n* [[Reversible error]]\n* [[Supreme Court of the United States]]\n* [[Writ of Certiorari]]\n* [[Writ of habeas corpus]]\n* [[Writ of mandamus]]\n*[[List of wrongful convictions in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:United States appellate procedure|*]]\n[[Category:United States procedural law]]\n[[Category:Legal procedure]]", "sha1": "63j9e0rezflqfw3t8rzzig155m9g4nu"}}, {"title": "Answer (law)", "ns": "0", "id": "642", "revision": {"id": "793784622", "parentid": "780371012", "timestamp": "2017-08-03T22:54:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "DavidBrooks-AWB", "id": "20962961"}, "comment": "Add EB1911 parameters using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]", "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{other uses|Answer (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=August 2013}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=June 2013}}\n{{Civil procedure (United States)}}\n\nIn law, an '''Answer''' was originally a solemn assertion in opposition to someone or something, and thus generally any counter-statement or [[defense (legal)|defense]], a [[reply]] to a [[question]] or response, or [[objection (law)|objection]], or a correct solution of a problem.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Answer|volume=2|page=85}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[common law]], an '''Answer''' is the first [[pleading]] by a [[defendant]], usually filed and served upon the [[plaintiff]] within a certain strict time limit after a civil [[complaint]] or criminal [[information]] or [[indictment]] has been served upon the defendant.

This means that a party who is unsatisfied with the outcome of a trial may bring an [[appeal]] to contest that outcome. However, appeals may be costly, and the appellate court must find an error on the part of the court below that justifies upsetting the verdict. Therefore, only a small proportion of trial court decisions result in appeals. Some appellate courts, particularly supreme courts, have the power of [[discretionary review]], meaning that they can decide whether they will hear an appeal brought in a particular case.\n\n===Institutional titles===\nMany U.S. jurisdictions title their appellate court a '''''court of appeal''''' or '''''court of appeals'''''.<ref>The term ''court of appeals'' is not capitalized in carefully edited texts such as reference works, for example [http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Court+of+Appeal West's Encyclopedia of American Law] unless referring to a specific court or courts, but many legal professionals do not comply with this most common English usage shown in major dictionaries but rather capitalize this and many other legal texts.</ref> Historically, others have titled their appellate court a '''''court of errors''''' (or '''''court of errors and appeals'''''), on the premise that it was intended to correct errors made by lower courts. Examples of such courts include the [[New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals]] (which existed from 1844 to 1947), the Connecticut Supreme Court of Errors (which has been renamed the [[Connecticut Supreme Court]]), the Kentucky Court of Errors (renamed the [[Kentucky Supreme Court]]), and the Mississippi High Court of Errors and Appeals (since renamed the [[Supreme Court of Mississippi]]). In some jurisdictions, courts able to hear appeals are known as an '''appellate division'''.\n\nThe phrase \"court of appeals\" most often refers to intermediate appellate courts.  However, the New York system is different: the \"[[New York Court of Appeals]]\" is the highest appellate court; and the phrase \"[[New York Supreme Court]]\" applies to the trial court of general jurisdiction.\n\nDepending on the system, certain courts may serve as both trial courts and appellate courts, hearing appeals of decisions made by courts with more limited jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions have specialized appellate courts, such as the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]], which only hears appeals raised in criminal cases, and the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], which has general jurisdiction but derives most of its caseload from patent cases, on one hand, and appeals from the [[Court of Federal Claims]] on the other.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Court of Criminal Appeal (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Court of Criminal Appeals (disambiguation)]]\n*[[Court of Appeal (Hong Kong)]]\n*[[High Court (Hong Kong)]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n*Lax, Jeffrey R. \"Constructing Legal Rules on Appellate Courts.\" American Political Science Review 101.3 (2007): 591-604.

In response to arraignment, the accused is expected to enter a [[plea]]. Acceptable pleas vary among jurisdiction but they generally include \"guilty\", \"not guilty\", and the [[peremptory pleas]] (or pleas in bar) setting out reasons why a trial cannot proceed. Pleas of \"[[nolo contendere]]\" (no contest) and the \"[[Alford plea|''Alford'' plea]]\" are allowed in some circumstances.\n\n== Australia ==\n\nIn Australia, arraignment is the first of eleven stages in a criminal trial, and involves the [[court clerk|clerk]] of the [[court]] reading out the [[indictment]].

Use of video arraignment system allows the [[court]]s to conduct the requisite arraignment process without the need to transport the defendant to the [[courtroom]] by using an [[audio-visual]] link between the location where the defendant is being held and the courtroom.\n\nUse of the video arraignment process addresses the problems associated with having to transport defendants. The transportation of defendants requires time, puts additional demands on the public safety organizations to provide for the safety of the public, court personnel and for the security of the population held in detention. It also addresses the rising costs of transportation.\n\n==Guilty and not-guilty pleas==\nIf the defendant pleads guilty, an [[Preliminary hearing|evidentiary hearing]] usually follows. The court is not required to accept a guilty plea. During the hearing, the judge assesses the offense, the [[mitigating factor]]s, and the defendant's character, and passes [[Sentence (law)|sentence]].\n\nIf the defendant pleads [[not guilty (plea)|not guilty]], a date is set for a [[preliminary hearing]] or a [[trial]].\n\nIn the past, a defendant who refused to plead (or \"stood mute\") was subject to [[peine forte et dure]] ([[Law French]] for \"strong and hard punishment\"). Today in [[Common law|common-law]] jurisdictions, the court enters a plea of not guilty for a defendant who refuses to enter a plea.<ref>In Queensland, Australia, this matter is covered by statute.

Several of the sights on her trip inspired her, and they found their way into her poem, including the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]], the \"White City\" with its promise of the future contained within its alabaster buildings; the wheat fields of America's heartland [[Kansas]], through which her train was riding on July 16; and the majestic view of the [[Great Plains]] from high atop [[Pikes Peak]].\n\nOn the pinnacle of that mountain, the words of the poem started to come to her, and she wrote them down upon returning to her hotel room at the original [[Antlers Hilton Hotel|Antlers Hotel]]. The poem was initially published two years later in ''The Congregationalist'' to commemorate [[the Fourth of July.]] It quickly caught the public's fancy. Amended versions were published in 1904 and 1911.\n\nSeveral existing pieces of music were adapted to the poem. A [[hymn tune]] composed by [[Samuel A. Ward]] was generally considered the best music as early as 1910 and is still the popular tune today. Just as Bates had been inspired to write her poem, Ward, too, was inspired to compose his tune. The tune came to him while he was on a ferryboat trip from [[Coney Island]] back to his home in [[New York City]], after a leisurely summer day in 1882, and he immediately wrote it down. Supposedly, he was so anxious to capture the tune in his head, he asked fellow passenger friend Harry Martin for his shirt cuff to write the tune on. He composed the tune for the old hymn \"O Mother Dear, Jerusalem\", retitling the work \"Materna\". Ward's music combined with Bates's poem were first published together in 1910 and titled \"America the Beautiful\".<ref>{{cite book\n |title=Songs Sung Red, White, and Blue: The Stories Behind America's Best-Loved Patriotic Songs\n |first=Ace |last=Collins\n |page=19\n |publisher=Harper\n |year=2003\n |isbn= 0-06-051304-7\n |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kKsA1Qi8BBgC&pg=PA19#v=onepage&f=false}}</ref>\n\nWard died in 1903, not knowing the national stature his music would attain since the music was only first applied to the song in 1904. Bates was more fortunate since the song's popularity was well established by the time of her death in 1929.\n\nAt various times in the more than 100 years that have elapsed since the song was written, particularly during the [[John F. Kennedy]] administration, there have been efforts to give \"America the Beautiful\" legal status either as a national hymn or as a national anthem equal to, or in place of, \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\", but so far this has not succeeded.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} Proponents prefer \"America the Beautiful\" for various reasons, saying it is easier to sing, more melodic, and more adaptable to new orchestrations while still remaining as easily recognizable as \"[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]\". Some prefer \"America the Beautiful\" over \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" due to the latter's war-oriented imagery. Others prefer \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" for the same reason. While that national dichotomy has stymied any effort at changing the tradition of the national anthem, \"America the Beautiful\" continues to be held in high esteem by a large number of Americans.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nThis song was used as the background music of the television broadcast of the [[Tiangong-1]] launch.<ref>https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/sep/30/china-launch-america-the-beautiful</ref>\n\nThe song is often included in songbooks in a wide variety of religious congregations in the United States.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Lyrics==\n{| style=\"white-space:nowrap\"\n|+'''America.

The phrase and the song are also the namesake of the [[Shining Sea Bikeway]], a [[bike path]] in Bates's hometown of [[Falmouth, Massachusetts]]. The phrase is similar to the Latin phrase \"''{{Lang|la|[[A Mari Usque Ad Mare]]}}''\" (\"From sea to sea\"), which serves as the official motto of [[Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Martin|first1=Gary|title=From sea to shining sea|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/from%20sea%20to%20shining%20sea.html|website=Phrases.org|accessdate=24 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n\"Purple mountain majesties\" refers to the shade of the [[Pikes Peak]] in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], which inspired Bates to write the poem.<ref>http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904222648/http://www.americanheritage.org/Elementary_Extraction_15-America_the_Beautiful_TX.pdf |date=September 4, 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Books==\n[[Lynn Sherr]]'s 2001 book ''America the Beautiful'' discusses the origins of the song and the backgrounds of its authors in depth.

Assistive technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks that they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of interacting with, the [[technology]] needed to accomplish such tasks.\n\n==Adaptive technology==\nThe term adaptive technology is often used as the [[synonym]] for assistive technology; however, they are different terms. Assistive technology refers to \"any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://section508.gov/assistive-technology-act-1998|title=Assistive Technology Act of 1998 {{!}} Section508.gov|website=section508.gov|access-date=2016-04-04}}</ref> while adaptive technology covers items that are specifically designed for persons with disabilities and would seldom be used by non-disabled persons. In other words, \"assistive technology is any object or system that increases or maintains the capabilities of people with disabilities,\" while adaptive technology is \"any object or system that is specifically designed for the purpose of increasing or maintaining the capabilities of people with disabilities.\"<ref>{{cite web | title = Tennessee Science Standards | url = http://glencoe.mcgraw-hill.com/sites/dl/free/0078901359/594902/AAT_v4.pdf | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}</ref> Consequently, adaptive technology is a subset of assistive technology. Adaptive technology often refers specifically to electronic and information technology access.<ref>{{cite web | title = Assessing for Adaptive Technology Needs | url = http://dtn.tamu.edu/pdf/pp-assessingAT.ppt | accessdate = 2012-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==Mobility impairments==\n\n=== Wheelchairs ===\n{{Main|Wheelchair}}\nWheelchairs are devices that can be manually propelled or electrically propelled and that include a seating system and are designed to be a substitute for the normal mobility that most people enjoy. Wheelchairs and other mobility devices allow people to perform mobility related [[activities of daily living]] which include feeding, toileting, dressing, grooming, and bathing. The devices comes in a number of variations where they can be propelled either by hand or by motors where the occupant uses electrical controls to manage motors and seating control actuators through a [[joystick]], [[sip-and-puff]] control, or other input devices. Often there are handles behind the seat for someone else to do the pushing or input devices for caregivers. Wheelchairs are used by people for whom [[walking]] is difficult or impossible due to illness, injury, or disability. People with both sitting and walking disability often need to use a wheelchair or walker.\n\n=== Transfer devices ===\n{{Main|Patient lift}}\nPatient transfer devices generally allow patients with impaired mobility to be moved by caregivers between beds, wheelchairs, commodes, toilets, chairs, stretchers, shower benches, automobiles, swimming pools, and other patient support systems (i.e., radiology, surgical, or examining tables). The most common devices are [[Patient lift]]s (for vertical transfer), [[Transfer bench]]es, stretcher or convertible chairs (for lateral, supine transfer), sit-to-stand lifts (for moving patients from one seated position to another i.e., from wheelchairs to commodes), air bearing inflatable mattresses (for supine transfer i.e., transfer from a gurney to an operating room table), and sliding boards (usually used for transfer from a bed to a wheelchair). Highly dependent patients who cannot assist their caregiver in moving them often require a [[Patient lift]] (a floor or ceiling-suspended sling lift) which though invented in 1955 and in common use since the early 1960s is still considered the state-of-the-art transfer device by OSHA and the American Nursing Association.\n\n=== Walkers ===\n{{Main|Walker (mobility)|l1=Walker}}A [[walker (mobility)|walker]] or walking frame or Rollator is a tool for disabled people who need additional support to maintain balance or stability while walking. It consists of a frame that is about waist high, approximately twelve inches deep and slightly wider than the user. Walkers are also available in other sizes, such as for children, or for heavy people. Modern walkers are height-adjustable. The front two legs of the walker may or may not have wheels attached depending on the strength and abilities of the person using it. It is also common to see caster wheels or glides on the back legs of a walker with wheels on the front.<ref>C. Barru\u00e9. Personalization and Shared Autonomy in Assistive Technologies. Ph. Thesis. Universitat Polit\u00e8cnica de Catalunya. 2012</ref>\n\n=== Prosthesis ===\n{{Main|Prosthesis}}A '''prosthesis''', '''prosthetic''', or '''prosthetic limb'''  is a device that replaces a missing [[Human body|body]] part. It is part of the field of [[biomechatronics]], the science of using [[Mechanical system|mechanical]] devices with human [[muscle]], [[skeleton]], and [[nervous systems]] to assist or enhance motor control lost by [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]], [[disease]], or [[Congenital disorder|defect]]. Prostheses are typically used to replace parts lost by injury (traumatic) or missing from birth ([[congenital]]) or to supplement defective body parts. Inside the body, [[artificial heart valve]]s are in common use with [[artificial heart]]s and [[artificial lung|lungs]] seeing less common use but under active technology development. Other medical devices and aids that can be considered prosthetics include [[hearing aids]], [[visual prosthesis|artificial eyes]], [[palatal obturator]], [[Adjustable gastric band|gastric bands]], and [[dentures]].\n\nProstheses are specifically ''not'' [[orthoses]], although given certain circumstances a prosthesis might end up performing some or all of the same functionary benefits as an orthosis.  Prostheses are technically the complete finished item.  For instance, a C-Leg knee alone is ''not'' a prosthesis, but only a prosthetic ''component''. The complete prosthesis would consist of the attachment system&nbsp; to the residual limb \u2014 usually a \"socket\", and all the attachment hardware components all the way down to and including the terminal device. Keep this in mind as nomenclature is often interchanged.\n\nThe terms \"prosthetic\" and \"orthotic\" are adjectives used to describe devices such as a prosthetic knee.  The terms \"prosthetics\" and \"orthotics\" are used to describe the respective allied health fields.  The devices themselves are properly referred to as \"prostheses\" and \"orthoses\" in the plural and \"prosthesis\" and \"orthosis\" in the singular.\n\n== Visual impairments ==\n{{Main|Blindness#Management}}\nMany people with serious visual impairments live independently, using a wide range of tools and techniques.  Examples of assistive technology for visually impairment include screen readers, screen magnifiers, Braille embossers, desktop video magnifiers, and voice recorders.\n\n=== Screen readers ===\n{{Main|Screen reader}}\n\nScreen readers allow the visually impaired to easily access electronic information. These software programs connect to a computer to read the text displayed out loud. There are a variety of platforms and applications available for a variety of costs.[[File:English braille sample.jpg|thumb|Braille is a system of raised dots representing letters, numbers, punctuation, and words.]]\n\n=== Braille and braille embossers ===\n{{Main|Braille}}\nBraille is a system of raised dots formed into units called braille cells. A full braille cell is made up of six dots, with two parallel rows of three dots, but other combinations and quantities of dots represent other letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or words. People can then use their fingers to read the code of raised dots.\n\nA braille embosser is, simply put, a printer for braille. Instead of a standard printer adding ink onto a page, the braille embosser imprints the raised dots of braille onto a page. Some braille embossers combine both braille and ink so the documents can be read with either sight or touch.\n\n=== Desktop video magnifier ===\n{{Main|Video magnifier}}\nDesktop video magnifiers are electronic devices that use a camera and a display screen to perform digital magnification of printed materials. They enlarge printed pages for those with low vision. A camera connects to a monitor that displays real time images, and the user can control settings such as magnification, focus, contrast, underlining, highlighting, and other screen preferences. They come in a variety of sizes and styles; some are small and portable with handheld cameras, while others are much larger and mounted on a fixed stand.\n\n=== Screen magnification software ===\n{{Main|Screen magnifier}}\nA screen magnifier is software that interfaces with a computer's graphical output to present enlarged screen content. It allows users to enlarge the texts and graphics on their computer screens for easier viewing. Similar to desktop video magnifiers, this technology assists people with low vision. After the user loads the software into their computer's memory, it serves as a kind of \"computer magnifying glass.\" Wherever the computer cursor moves, it enlarges the area around it. This allows greater computer accessibility for a wide range of visual abilities.\n\n[[File:MAGic Large Print Keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|<center>This large-print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired</center>|alt=MAGic Large Print This MAGic large-print keyboard has tactile elements and special keys for the visually impaired]]\n\n=== Large-print and tactile keyboards ===\nA large-print keyboard has large letters printed on the keys.  On the keyboard shown, the round buttons at the top control software which can magnify the screen (zoom in), change the background color of the screen, or make the mouse cursor on the screen larger.  The \"bump dots\" on the keys, installed in this case by the organization using the keyboards, help the user find the right keys in a tactile way.\n\n=== Navigation Assistance ===\n[[GPS_for_the_visually_impaired|Assistive technology for navigation]] has exploded on the [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp IEEE Xplore database] since 2000, with over 7,500 engineering articles written on assistive technologies and visual impairment in the past 25 years, and over 1,300 articles on solving the problem of navigation for people who are blind or visually impaired. As well, over 600 articles on augmented reality and visual impairment have appeared in the engineering literature since 2000. Most of these articles were published within the past 5 years, and the number of articles in this area is increasing every year. GPS, accelerometers, gyroscopes, and cameras can pinpoint the exact location of the user and provide information on what\u2019s in the immediate vicinity, and assistance in getting to a destination.\n\nSome navigation assistants (for both indoors and outdoors) include:\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/ariadne-gps/id441063072?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%253D4 Ariadne GPS]\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/app/be-my-eyes-helping-blind-see/id905177575?mt=8 Be My Eyes]\n# [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QWzBye_cATY Blavigator]\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/blindsquare/id500557255?mt=8 BlindSquare]\n# [http://store.humanware.com/hus/braillenote-gps-software-and-receiver-package.html BrailleNote GPS]\n# [https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/the-buzzclip-wearable-mobility-tool-for-the-blind#/ Buzzclip]\n# [http://cydalion.com/ Cydalion]\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/eyemusic-hearing-colored-shapes/id805461054?mt=8 EyeMusic]\n# [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.LewLasher.getthere&hl=en GetThere]\n# [https://horus.tech/?l=en_us Horus]\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lowviz-guide-indoor-navigation/id987917857 Low Viz Guide]\n# [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.aph.avigenie&hl=en Nearby Explorer]\n# [http://www.perceptwayfinding.com/ PERCEPT System]\n# [http://download.cnet.com/Sendero-GPS-LookAround/3000-12940_4-75300879.html Sendero GPS LookAround]\n# [https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/talking-goggles-camera-speech/id602999586?mt=8 Talking Goggles]\n# [https://www.seeingwithsound.com/ The vOICe]\n# [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.eyesfree.walkytalky WalkyTalky]\n\n==Personal emergency response systems==\n{{Main|Telecare}}\n[[File:Head-wand.jpg|thumb|This voter with a [[manual dexterity]] disability is making choices on a [[touchscreen]] with a head dauber]]\n[[Personal emergency response systems]] (PERS), or [[Telecare]] (UK term), are a particular sort of assistive technology that use electronic sensors connected to an alarm system to help caregivers manage risk and help vulnerable people stay independent at home longer. An example would be the systems being put in place for senior people such as fall detectors, thermometers (for [[hypothermia]] risk), flooding and unlit gas sensors (for people with mild [[dementia]]). Notably, these alerts can be customized to the particular person's risks. When the alert is triggered, a message is sent to a caregiver or contact center who can respond appropriately.\n\n==Accessibility software==\n{{Main|Computer accessibility}}\nIn human\u2013computer interaction, computer accessibility (also known as accessible computing) refers to the accessibility of a computer system to all people, regardless of disability or severity of impairment, examples include [[web accessibility]] guidelines.<ref>[http://www.learningdisabilities.org.uk/page.cfm?pagecode=ISSIWD Web accessibility guidelines]</ref> Another approach is for the user to present a token to the computer terminal, such as a smart card, that has configuration information to adjust the computer speed, text size, etc. to their particular needs. This is useful where users want to access public computer based terminals in Libraries, ATM, Information kiosks etc. The concept is encompassed by the CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface.<ref>[http://www.cen.eu/cen/Sectors/TechnicalCommitteesWorkshops/CENTechnicalCommittees/Pages/TCStruc.aspx?param=6205&title=Personal%20identification,%20electronic%20signature%20and%20cards%20and%20their%20related%20systems%20and%20operations CEN EN 1332-4 Identification Card Systems - Man-Machine Interface]</ref> This development of this standard has been supported in Europe by [[SNAPI]] and has been successfully incorporated into the [[Lasseo]] specifications, but with limited success due to the lack of interest from public computer terminal suppliers.\n\n==Hearing impairments==\n{{Main|Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing}}\nThe deaf or hard of hearing community has a difficult time to communicate and perceive information as compared to hearing individuals. Thus, these individuals often rely on visual and tactile mediums for receiving and communicating information. The use of assistive technology and devices provides this community with various solutions to their problems by providing higher sound (for those who are hard of hearing), tactile feedback, visual cues and improved technology access. Individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing utilize a variety of assistive technologies that provide them with improved accessibility to information in numerous environments.<ref>{{cite web | title = Assistive Technology for Individuals who are Deaf or Hard of Hearing | url = http://www.wati.org/content/supports/free/pdf/Ch13-Hearing.pdf | accessdate = 2015-11-08}}</ref> Most devices either provide amplified sound or alternate ways to access information through vision and/or vibration. These technologies can be grouped into three general categories: [[Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing#Hearing Technology|Hearing Technology]], alerting devices, and [[Assistive Technology for Deaf and Hard of Hearing#Communication Support|communication support]].\n\n=== Hearing aids ===\n{{Main|Hearing aid}}\nA hearing aid or deaf aid is an electroacoustic device which is designed to amplify sound for the wearer, usually with the aim of making speech more intelligible, and to correct impaired hearing as measured by audiometry. This type of assistive technology helps people with hearing loss participate more fully in their communities by allowing them to hear more clearly. They amplify any and all sound waves through use of a microphone, amplifier, and speaker. There is a wide variety of hearing aids available, including digital, in-the-ear, in-the-canal, behind-the-ear, and on-the-body aids.\n\n=== Assistive listening devices ===\n{{Main|Assistive listening device}}\nAssistive listening devices include FM, infrared, and loop assistive listening devices. This type of technology allows people with hearing difficulties to focus on a speaker or subject by getting rid of extra background noises and distractions, making places like auditoriums, classrooms, and meetings much easier to participate in. The assistive listening device usually uses a microphone to capture an audio source near to its origin and broadcast it wirelessly over an FM (Frequency Modulation) transmission, IR (Infra Red) transmission, IL (Induction Loop) transmission, or other transmission method. The person who is listening may use an FM/IR/IL Receiver to tune into the signal and listen at his/her preferred volume.\n\n=== Amplified telephone equipment ===\n{{Main|Telecommunications device for the deaf|l1=Telecommunications device for the deaf#Other devices for the deaf or hard of hearing}}\nThis type of assistive technology allows users to amplify the volume and clarity of their phone calls so that they can easily partake in this medium of communication. There are also options to adjust the frequency and tone of a call to suit their individual hearing needs. Additionally, there is a wide variety of amplified telephones to choose from, with different degrees of amplification. For example, a phone with 26 to 40 decibel is generally sufficient for mild hearing loss, while a phone with 71 to 90 decibel is better for more severe hearing loss.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Guide to Amplified Phones|url = https://assistech.com/store/amplified-telephone-guide|website = assistech.com|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref>\n\n==Augmentative and alternative communication==\n{{Main|Augmentative and alternative communication}}\n[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|thumb|An AAC user uses number coding on an eye gaze communication board]]\n'''Augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)''' is an umbrella term that encompasses methods of communication for those with impairments or restrictions on the production or comprehension of spoken or written language.<ref name=asha2005>[[#refASHA2005|ASHA (2005)]].</ref> AAC systems are extremely diverse and depend on the capabilities of the user.

Many memory aids are used for cognitive impairments such as reading, writing, or organizational difficulties. For example, a Smartpen records handwritten notes by creating both a digital copy and an audio recording of the text. Users simply tap certain parts of their notes and the pen saves it and reads it back to them. From there, the user can also download their notes onto a computer for increased accessibility. Digital voice recorders are also used to record \"in the moment\" information for fast and easy recall at a later time.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Using External Aids to Compensate for Memory and Organizational Problems Post-TBI|url = http://www.brainline.org/content/2011/04/using-external-aids-to-compensate-for-memory-and-organizational-problems-post-tbi.html|accessdate = 2015-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Educational software ===\n{{Main|Educational software}}\n\nEducational software is software that assists people with reading, learning, comprehension, and organizational difficulties. Any accommodation software such as text readers, notetakers, text enlargers, organization tools, word predictions, and talking word processors falls under the category of educational software.\n\n==Assistive technology in sport==\n[[File:NYC Marathon wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A [[New York City Marathon]] competitor uses a racing wheelchair]]\nAssistive technology in sport is an area of technology design that is growing. Assistive technology is the array of new devices created to enable sports enthusiasts who have disabilities to play. Assistive technology may be used in [[adaptive sports]], where an existing sport is modified to enable players with a disability to participate; or, assistive technology may be used to invent completely new sports with athletes with disabilities exclusively in mind.\n\nAn increasing number of people with disabilities are participating in sports, leading to the development of new assistive technology.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Scherer, Marcia  |author2=Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=425}}</ref> Assistive technology devices can be simple, or \"low-tech\", or they may use highly advanced technology, with some even using computers.

More complex assistive technology devices have been developed over time, and as a result, sports for people with disabilities \"have changed from being a clinical therapeutic tool to an increasingly competition-oriented activity\".<ref>{{cite book|author1=Scherer, Marcia  |author2=Stefano Federici|title=Assistive Technology Assessment Handbook|year=2012|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=9781439838655|page=427}}</ref>\n\n==Assistive technology in education==\nIn the United States there are two major pieces of legislation that govern the use of assistive technology within the school system. The first is Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the second being the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) which was first enacted in 1975 under the name The Education for All Handicapped Children Act.  In 2004, during the reauthorization period for IDEA, the National Instructional Material Access Center (NIMAC) was created which provided a repository of accessible text including publisher's textbooks to students with a qualifying disability.  Files provided are in XML format and used as a starting platform for braille readers, screen readers, and other digital text software.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nimac.us/ |title=National Instructional Materials Access Center }}</ref>  IDEA defines assistive technology as follows: \"any item, piece of equipment, or product system, whether acquired commercially off the shelf, modified, or customized, that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of a child with a disability. (B) Exception.--The term does not include a medical device that is surgically implanted, or the replacement of such device.\" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://idea.ed.gov/explore/view/p/,root,statute,I,A,602,1, |title=Building the Legacy: IDEA 2004}}</ref>\n\nAssistive technology in this area is broken down into low, mid, and high tech categories. Low tech encompasses equipment that is often low cost and does not include batteries or requires charging. Examples include adapted paper and pencil grips for writing or masks and color overlays for reading. Mid tech supports used in the school setting include the use of handheld spelling dictionaries and portable word processors used to keyboard writing. High tech supports involve the use of tablet devices and computers with accompanying software. Software supports for  writing include the use of auditory feedback while keyboarding, word prediction for spelling, and speech to text. Supports for reading include the use of text to speech (TTS) software and font modification via access to digital text. Limited supports are available for math instruction and mostly consist of grid based software to allow younger students to keyboard equations and auditory feedback of more complex equations using MathML and Daisy.\n\n==Computer accessibility==\n{{Main|Computer accessibility}}\n[[File:Sip-and-puff device.jpg|thumb|A [[sip-and-puff]] device which allows a person with substantial disability to make selections and navigate computerized interfaces by controlling inhalations and exhalations]]\nOne of the largest problems that affect people with disabilities is discomfort with prostheses.<ref name=hussein>{{cite journal|last=Abdullah|first=Hussein A.|author2=Tarry, Cole|author3=Datta, Rahul.|author4=Mittal, Gauri S.|author5=Abderrahim, Mohamed|title=Dynamic Biomechanical Model for Assessing and Monitoring Robot-Assisted Upper-Limb Therapy|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development|year=2007|volume=44|issue=1|pages=43\u201362|doi=10.1682/JRRD.2006.03.0025|pmid=17551857}}</ref> An experiment performed in Massachusetts utilized 20 people with various sensors attached to their arms.<ref name=hussein /> The subjects tried different arm exercises, and the sensors recorded their movements.

The Pererro is a plug and play adapter for [[iOS]] devices which uses the built in [[Apple VoiceOver]] feature in combination with a basic switch. This brings touch screen technology to those who were previously unable to use it. Apple, with the release of iOS 7 had introduced the ability to navigate apps using switch control. Switch access could be activated either through an external bluetooth connected switch, single touch of the screen, or use of right and left head turns using the device's camera. Additional accessibility features include the use of Assistive Touch which allows a user to access multi-touch gestures through pre-programmed onscreen buttons.\n\nFor users with physical disabilities a large variety of switches are available and customizable to the user's needs varying in size, shape, or amount of pressure required for activation. [[Switch access]] may be placed near any area of the body which has consistent and reliable mobility and less subject to fatigue. Common sites include the hands, head, and feet. Eye gaze and head mouse systems can also be used as an alternative mouse navigation. A user may utilize single or multiple switch sites and the process often involves a  scanning through items on a screen and activating the switch once the desired object is highlighted.\n\n==Home automation==\nThe form of [[home automation]] called [[assistive domotics]] focuses on making it possible for elderly and disabled people to live independently. Home automation is becoming a viable option for the elderly and disabled who would prefer to stay in their own homes rather than move to a healthcare facility. This field uses much of the same technology and equipment as home automation for security, entertainment, and energy conservation but tailors it towards elderly and disabled users. For example, automated prompts and reminders utilize motion sensors and pre-recorded audio messages; an automated prompt in the kitchen may remind the resident to turn off the oven, and one by the front door may remind the resident to lock the door.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Assistive technology - devices to help with everyday living|url = https://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=109|website = www.alzheimers.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-30|language = en|first = Natasha|last = Judd}}</ref>\n\n== Impacts of assistive technology ==\nOverall, assistive technology aims to allow people with disabilities to \"participate more fully in all aspects of life (home, school, and community)\" and increases their opportunities for \"education, social interactions, and potential for meaningful employment.\"<ref>{{Cite web|title = Considering Assistive Technology {{!}} Center for Parent Information and Resources|url = http://www.parentcenterhub.org/repository/considering-at/|website = www.parentcenterhub.org|accessdate = 2015-11-25}}</ref> It creates greater independence and control for disabled individuals.

Today, abaci are often constructed as a bamboo frame with beads sliding on wires, but originally they were beans or stones moved in grooves in sand or on tablets of wood, stone, or metal.\n\nAbaci come in different designs. Some designs, like the bead frame consisting of beads divided into tens, are used mainly to teach arithmetic, although they remain popular in the [[post-Soviet states]] as a tool. Other designs, such as the Japanese [[soroban]], have been used for practical calculations even involving several digits. For any particular abacus design, there usually are numerous different methods to perform a certain type of calculation, which may include basic operations like addition and multiplication, or even more complex ones, such as calculating [[Square root|square roots]]. Some of these methods may work with non-[[Natural number|natural]] numbers (numbers such as {{Math|1.5}} and {{Math|{{Frac|3|4}}}}).\n\nAlthough today many use [[Calculator|calculators]] and [[Computer|computers]] instead of abaci to calculate, abaci still remain in common use in some countries. Merchants, traders and clerks in some parts of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Russia]], [[China]] and [[Africa]] use abaci, and they are still used to teach arithmetic to children.<ref name=\"Boyer253\" /> Some people who are unable to use a calculator because of visual impairment may use an abacus.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe use of the word ''abacus'' dates before 1387 AD, when a [[Middle English]] work borrowed the word from [[Latin]] to describe a sandboard abacus.

It usually has more than seven rods. There are two beads on each rod in the upper deck and five beads each in the bottom. The beads are usually rounded and made of a [[hardwood]]. The beads are counted by moving them up or down towards the beam. If you move them toward the beam, you count their value. If you move away, you don't count their value.<ref name=\"ryerson\">{{harvnb|Fernandes|2003}}</ref> The suanpan can be reset to the starting position instantly by a quick movement along the horizontal axis to spin all the beads away from the horizontal beam at the center.\n\nSuanpans can be used for functions other than counting. Unlike the simple counting board used in elementary schools, very efficient suanpan techniques have been developed to do [[multiplication]], [[division (mathematics)|division]], [[addition]], [[subtraction]], [[square root]] and [[cube root]] operations at high speed. There are currently schools teaching students how to use it.\n\nIn the long scroll ''[[Along the River During the Qingming Festival]]'' painted by [[Zhang Zeduan]] (1085\u20131145 AD) during the [[Song dynasty]] (960\u20131297 AD), a suanpan is clearly seen lying beside an account book and doctor's prescriptions on the counter of an [[apothecary]]'s (Feibao).\n\nThe similarity of the [[Roman abacus]] to the Chinese one suggests that one could have inspired the other, as there is some evidence of a trade relationship between the [[Roman Empire]] and China. However, no direct connection can be demonstrated, and the similarity of the abaci may be coincidental, both ultimately arising from counting with five fingers per hand. Where the Roman model (like most modern Korean and [[#Japanese abacus|Japanese]]) has 4 plus 1 bead per decimal place, the standard suanpan has 5 plus 2. (Incidentally, this allows use with a [[hexadecimal]] numeral system, which was used for traditional Chinese measures of weight.) Instead of running on wires as in the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese models, the beads of Roman model run in grooves, presumably making arithmetic calculations much slower.\n\nAnother possible source of the suanpan is Chinese [[counting rods]], which operated with a [[decimal|decimal system]] but lacked the concept of [[0 (number)|zero]] as a place holder. The zero was probably introduced to the Chinese in the [[Tang dynasty]] (618-907 AD) when travel in the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[Middle East]] would have provided direct contact with [[India]], allowing them to acquire the concept of zero and the [[decimal point]] from Indian merchants and mathematicians.\n\n===Roman===\n{{Main|Roman abacus}}\n[[File:RomanAbacusRecon.jpg|right|thumb|Copy of a [[Roman abacus]]]]\nThe normal method of calculation in ancient Rome, as in Greece, was by moving counters on a smooth table. Originally pebbles (''calculi'') were used. Later, and in medieval Europe, [[jeton]]s were manufactured. Marked lines indicated units, fives, tens etc. as in the [[Roman numeral]] system. This system of 'counter casting' continued into the late Roman empire and in medieval Europe, and persisted in limited use into the nineteenth century.<ref>{{harvnb|Pullan|1968|p=18}}</ref> Due to [[Pope Sylvester II]]'s reintroduction of the abacus with very useful modifications, it became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century<ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2010|pp=81\u201382}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Brown|2011}}</ref> This abacus used beads on wires, unlike the traditional Roman counting boards, which meant the abacus could be used much faster.<ref>{{harvnb|Huff|1993|p=50}}</ref>\n\nWriting in the 1st century BC, Horace refers to the wax abacus, a board covered with a thin layer of black wax on which columns and figures were inscribed using a stylus.<ref name=rome>{{harvnb|Ifrah|2001|p=18}}</ref>\n\nOne example of archaeological evidence of the [[Roman abacus]], shown here in reconstruction, dates to the 1st century AD. It has eight long grooves containing up to five beads in each and eight shorter grooves having either one or no beads in each. The groove marked I indicates units, X tens, and so on up to millions. The beads in the shorter grooves denote fives \u2013five units, five tens etc., essentially in a [[bi-quinary coded decimal]] system, obviously related to the [[Roman numerals]]. The short grooves on the right may have been used for marking Roman \"ounces\" (i.e. fractions).\n\n===Indian===\nThere is no clear evidence for use of the abacus in India. The decimal number system invented in India replaced the abacus in Western Europe.<ref name=\"UniOfNthC1\">{{Citation|url=http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/roman.html|title=Roman and \"Arabic\" Numerals|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=2004-07-04|publisher=[[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]]|accessdate=2009-06-22}}</ref>\n\nThe ''[[Abhidharmako\u015babh\u0101\u1e63ya]]'' of [[Vasubandhu]] (316-396), a Sanskrit work on Buddhist philosophy, says that the second-century CE philosopher [[Vasumitra]] said that \"placing a wick (Sanskrit ''vartik\u0101'') on the number one (''ek\u0101\u1e45ka'') means it is a one, while placing the wick on the number hundred means it is called a hundred, and on the number one thousand means it is a thousand\".

The use of the soroban is still taught in Japanese [[primary school]]s as part of [[mathematics]], primarily as an aid to faster mental calculation.

Its complete meaning was taken as: counting with small similar elements by somebody. Its use was taught in the [[Calmecac]] to the ''temalpouhqueh'' {{IPA-nah|tema\u026c\u02c8po\u028dke\u0294|}}, who were students dedicated to take the accounts of skies, from childhood.\n\nThe Nep\u014dhualtzintzin was divided in two main parts separated by a bar or intermediate cord. In the left part there were four beads, which in the first row have unitary values (1, 2, 3, and 4), and in the right side there are three beads with values of 5, 10, and 15 respectively. In order to know the value of the respective beads of the upper rows, it is enough to multiply by 20 (by each row), the value of the corresponding account in the first row.\n\nAltogether, there were 13 rows with 7 beads in each one, which made up 91 beads in each Nep\u014dhualtzintzin. This was a basic number to understand, 7 times 13, a close relation conceived between natural phenomena, the underworld and the cycles of the heavens. One Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (91) represented the number of days that a season of the year lasts, two Nep\u014dhualtzitzin (182) is the number of days of the corn's cycle, from its sowing to its harvest, three Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (273) is the number of days of a baby's gestation, and four Nep\u014dhualtzintzin (364) completed a cycle and approximate a year (1{{sfrac|1|4}} days short). When translated into modern computer arithmetic, the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin amounted to the rank from 10 to the 18 in [[floating point]], which calculated stellar as well as infinitesimal amounts with absolute precision, meant that no round off was allowed.\n\nThe rediscovery of the Nep\u014dhualtzintzin was due to the Mexican engineer David Esparza Hidalgo,<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|p=94}}</ref> who in his wanderings throughout Mexico found diverse engravings and paintings of this instrument and reconstructed several of them made in gold, jade, encrustations of shell, etc.<ref>{{harvnb|Hidalgo|1977|pp=94\u2013101}}</ref> There have also been found very old Nep\u014dhualtzintzin attributed to the [[Olmec]] culture, and even some bracelets of [[Maya peoples|Maya]]n origin, as well as a diversity of forms and materials in other cultures.\n\nGeorge I. Sanchez, \"Arithmetic in Maya\", Austin-Texas, 1961 found another base 5, base 4 abacus in the [[Yucat\u00e1n peninsula]] that also computed calendar data. This was a finger abacus, on one hand 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were used; and on the other hand 0, 1, 2 and 3 were used. Note the use of zero at the beginning and end of the two cycles. Sanchez worked with [[Sylvanus Morley]], a noted Mayanist.\n\nThe [[quipu]] of the [[Inca]]s was a system of colored knotted cords used to record numerical data,<ref>{{harvnb|Albree|2000|p=42}}</ref> like advanced [[tally stick]]s \u2013 but not used to perform calculations. Calculations were carried out using a [[yupana]] ([[Quechua languages|Quechua]] for \"counting tool\"; see figure) which was still in use after the conquest of Peru. The working principle of a yupana is unknown, but in 2001 an explanation of the mathematical basis of these instruments was proposed by Italian mathematician Nicolino De Pasquale. By comparing the form of several yupanas, researchers found that calculations were based using the [[Fibonacci sequence]] 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and powers of 10, 20 and 40 as place values for the different fields in the instrument. Using the Fibonacci sequence would keep the number of grains within any one field at a minimum.<ref>{{harvnb|Aimi|De Pasquale|2005}}</ref>\n\n===Russian===\n[[File:Schoty abacus.jpg|thumb|Russian abacus]]\nThe Russian abacus, the ''schoty'' (\u0441\u0447\u0451\u0442\u044b), usually has a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually positioned near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires from left to right in the manner of a book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep the beads pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all the beads are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.\n\nAs a simple, cheap and reliable device, the Russian abacus was in use in all shops and markets throughout the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|former Soviet Union]], and the usage of it was taught in most schools until the 1990s.<ref>{{harvnb|Burnett|Ryan|1998|p=7}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Hudgins|2004|p=219}}</ref> Even the 1874 invention of [[mechanical calculator]], [[Odhner Arithmometer|Odhner arithmometer]], had not replaced them in [[Russia]] and likewise the mass production of Felix arithmometers since 1924 did not significantly reduce their use in the [[Soviet Union]].<ref>{{harvnb|Leushina|1991|p=427}}</ref> The Russian abacus began to lose popularity only after the mass production of [[Pocket calculator|microcalculators]] had started in the Soviet Union in 1974.

It is still often seen as a plastic or wooden toy.\n\nThe wire frame may be used either with positional notation like other abaci (thus the 10-wire version may represent numbers up to 9,999,999,999), or each bead may represent one unit (so that e.g. 74 can be represented by shifting all beads on 7 wires and 4 beads on the 8th wire, so numbers up to 100 may be represented). In the bead frame shown, the gap between the 5th and 6th wire, corresponding to the color change between the 5th and the 6th bead on each wire, suggests the latter use.\n\nThe red-and-white abacus is used in contemporary primary schools for a wide range of number-related lessons. The twenty bead version, referred to by its [[Dutch language|Dutch]] name ''rekenrek'' (\"calculating frame\"), is often used, sometimes on a string of beads, sometimes on a rigid framework.<ref>{{harvnb|West|2011|p=49}}</ref>\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Renaissance abaci gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Gregor Reisch, Margarita Philosophica, 1508 (1230x1615).png\nFile:Rechentisch.png\nFile:Rechnung auff der Linihen und Federn.JPG\nFile:K\u00f6bel B\u00f6schenteyn 1514.jpg\nFile:Rechnung auff der linihen 1525 Adam Ries.PNG\nFile:1543 Robert Recorde.PNG\nFile:Peter Apian 1544.PNG\nFile:Adam riesen.jpg\nFile:Rekenaar 1553.jpg\n</gallery>\n\n==Uses by the blind==\nAn adapted abacus, invented by Tim Cranmer, called a '''Cranmer abacus''' is still commonly used by individuals who are [[blindness|blind]].

In the special case of aqueous solutions, proton donors form the [[hydronium ion]] H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> and are known as [[Acid-base reaction#Arrhenius theory|Arrhenius acids]]. [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted|Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry|Lowry]] generalized the Arrhenius theory to include non-aqueous solvents. A Br\u00f8nsted or Arrhenius acid usually contains a hydrogen atom bonded to a chemical structure that is still energetically favorable after loss of H<sup>+</sup>.\n\nAqueous Arrhenius acids have characteristic properties which provide a practical description of an acid.<ref>Petrucci R.H., Harwood, R.S. and Herring, F.G. ''General Chemistry'' (8th ed., Prentice-Hall 2002) p.146 {{ISBN|0-13-014329-4}}</ref> Acids form [[aqueous solution]]s with a sour taste, can turn blue [[litmus]] red, and react with [[Base (chemistry)|bases]] and certain metals (like [[calcium]]) to form [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]]. The word ''acid'' is derived from the [[Latin]] ''acidus/ac\u0113re'' meaning ''sour''.<ref>[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/acid Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary: ''acid'']</ref> An aqueous solution of an acid has a [[pH]] less than 7 and is colloquially also referred to as 'acid' (as in 'dissolved in acid'), while the strict definition<ref name=\"IUPAC_acid\"/> refers only to the [[solution|solute]]. A lower pH means a higher acidity, and thus a higher concentration of [[Hydron (chemistry)|positive hydrogen ions]] in the [[solution]]. Chemicals or substances having the property of an acid are said to be '''acidic'''.\n\nCommon aqueous acids include [[hydrochloric acid]] (a solution of [[hydrogen chloride]] which is found in [[gastric acid]] in the stomach and activates [[digestive enzymes]]), [[acetic acid]] (vinegar is a dilute aqueous solution of this liquid), [[sulfuric acid]] (used in [[car battery|car batteries]]), and [[citric acid]] (found in citrus fruits). As these examples show, acids (in the colloquial sense) can be solutions or pure substances, and can be derived from acids (in the strict<ref name=\"IUPAC_acid\"/> sense) that are solids, liquids, or gases. [[Acid strength|Strong acid]]s and some concentrated weak acids are [[corrosive substance|corrosive]], but there are exceptions such as [[carborane]]s and [[boric acid]].\n\nThe second category of acids are [[Lewis acids and bases|Lewis acids]], which form a covalent bond with an electron pair. An example is [[boron trifluoride]] (BF<sub>3</sub>), whose boron atom has a vacant [[atomic orbital|orbital]] which can form a covalent bond by sharing a lone pair of electrons on an atom in a base, for example the nitrogen atom in [[ammonia]] (NH<sub>3</sub>). [[Gilbert N. Lewis|Lewis]] considered this as a generalization of the Br\u00f8nsted definition, so that an acid is a chemical species that accepts electron pairs either directly ''or'' by releasing protons (H<sup>+</sup>) into the solution, which then accept electron pairs. However, hydrogen chloride, acetic acid, and most other Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids cannot form a covalent bond with an electron pair and are therefore not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\">Oxtoby, D. W; Gillis, H.P., Butler, L. J.

In modern terminology, an ''acid'' is implicitly a Br\u00f8nsted acid and not a Lewis acid, since chemists almost always refer to a Lewis acid explicitly as ''a Lewis acid''.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\" />\n\n==Definitions and concepts==\n{{main|Acid\u2013base reaction}}\nModern definitions are concerned with the fundamental chemical reactions common to all acids.\n\nMost acids encountered in everyday life are [[aqueous solutions]], or can be dissolved in water, so the Arrhenius and Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definitions are the most relevant.\n\nThe Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry definition is the most widely used definition; unless otherwise specified, acid-base reactions are assumed to involve the transfer of a proton (H<sup>+</sup>) from an acid to a base.\n\nHydronium ions are acids according to all three definitions. Interestingly, although alcohols and amines can be Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids, they can also function as [[Lewis base]]s due to the lone pairs of electrons on their oxygen and nitrogen atoms.\n\n===Arrhenius acids===\n[[File:Arrhenius2.jpg|thumb|150px|Svante Arrhenius]]\n\nThe Swedish chemist [[Svante Arrhenius]] attributed the properties of acidity to [[hydron (chemistry)|hydrogen ions]] (H<sup>+</sup>) or [[proton]]s in 1884. An '''Arrhenius acid''' is a substance that, when added to water, increases the concentration of H<sup>+</sup> ions in the water.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\"/><ref name=\"Ebbing\">Ebbing, D.D., & Gammon, S. D. (2005). ''General chemistry'' (8th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin. {{ISBN|0-618-51177-6}}</ref> Note that chemists often write H<sup>+</sup>(''aq'') and refer to the [[hydrogen ion]] when describing acid-base reactions but the free hydrogen nucleus, a [[proton]], does not exist alone in water, it exists as the hydronium ion, H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup>. Thus, an Arrhenius acid can also be described as a substance that increases the concentration of hydronium ions when added to water. Examples include molecular substances such as HCl and acetic acid.\n\nAn Arrhenius [[base (chemistry)|base]], on the other hand, is a substance which increases the concentration of [[hydroxide]] (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions when dissolved in water. This decreases the concentration of hydronium because the ions react to form H<sub>2</sub>O molecules:\n\nH<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + OH{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} \u21cc H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nDue to this equilibrium, any increase in the concentration of hydronium is accompanied by a decrease in the concentration of hydroxide. Thus, an Arrhenius acid could also be said to be one that decreases hydroxide concentration, while an Arrhenius base increases it.\n\nIn an acidic solution, the concentration of hydronium ions is greater than 10<sup>\u22127</sup> [[Mole (unit)|moles]] per liter. Since pH is defined as the negative logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions, acidic solutions thus have a pH of less than 7.\n\n===Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acids{{anchor|Br\u00f8nsted acids}}===\n{{Main|Br\u00f8nsted\u2013Lowry acid\u2013base theory}}\n\n[[File:Acetic-acid-dissociation-3D-balls.png|thumb|350px|alt=Acetic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH, is composed of a methyl group, CH<sub>3</sub>, bound chemically to a carboxylate group, COOH. The carboxylate group can lose a proton and donate it to a water molecule, H<sub>2</sub>0, leaving behind an acetate anion CH<sub>3</sub>COO- and creating a hydronium cation H<sub>3</sub>O. This is an equilibrium reaction, so the reverse process can also take place.|[[Acetic acid]], a [[weak acid]], donates a proton (hydrogen ion, highlighted in green) to water in an equilibrium reaction to give the [[acetate]] ion and the [[hydronium]] ion. Red: oxygen, black: carbon, white: hydrogen.]]\n\nWhile the Arrhenius concept is useful for describing many reactions, it is also quite limited in its scope. In 1923 chemists [[Johannes Nicolaus Br\u00f8nsted]] and [[Thomas Martin Lowry]] independently recognized that acid-base reactions involve the transfer of a proton. A '''Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid''' (or simply Br\u00f8nsted acid) is a species that donates a proton to a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry base.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid-base theory has several advantages over Arrhenius theory. Consider the following reactions of [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH), the [[organic acid]] that gives vinegar its characteristic taste:\n\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|H|2|O}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|H|3|O|+}}\n:{{chem|CH|3|COOH}} + {{chem|NH|3}} {{eqm}} {{chem|CH|3|COO|\u2212}} + {{chem|NH|4|+}}\n\nBoth theories easily describe the first reaction: CH<sub>3</sub>COOH acts as an Arrhenius acid because it acts as a source of H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> when dissolved in water, and it acts as a Br\u00f8nsted acid by donating a proton to water. In the second example CH<sub>3</sub>COOH undergoes the same transformation, in this case donating a proton to ammonia (NH<sub>3</sub>), but does not relate to the Arrhenius definition of an acid because the reaction does not produce hydronium. Nevertheless, CH<sub>3</sub>COOH is both an Arrhenius and a Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acid.\n\nBr\u00f8nsted-Lowry theory can be used to describe reactions of [[molecule|molecular compounds]] in nonaqueous solution or the gas phase. [[Hydrogen chloride]] (HCl) and ammonia combine under several different conditions to form [[ammonium chloride]], NH<sub>4</sub>Cl. In aqueous solution HCl behaves as [[hydrochloric acid]] and exists as hydronium and chloride ions. The following reactions illustrate the limitations of Arrhenius's definition:\n# H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH<sub>3</sub> \u2192 Cl{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + NH{{su|b=4|p=+}}<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O\n# HCl<sub>(benzene)</sub> + NH<sub>3(benzene)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n# HCl<sub>(g)</sub> + NH<sub>3(g)</sub> \u2192 NH<sub>4</sub>Cl<sub>(s)</sub>\n\nAs with the acetic acid reactions, both definitions work for the first example, where water is the solvent and hydronium ion is formed by the HCl solute. The next two reactions do not involve the formation of ions but are still proton-transfer reactions. In the second reaction hydrogen chloride and ammonia (dissolved in [[benzene]]) react to form solid ammonium chloride in a benzene solvent and in the third gaseous HCl and NH<sub>3</sub> combine to form the solid.\n\n===Lewis acids===\n{{main article|Lewis acids and bases}}\nA third, only marginally related concept was proposed in 1923 by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]], which includes reactions with acid-base characteristics that do not involve a proton transfer. A '''Lewis acid''' is a species that accepts a pair of electrons from another species; in other words, it is an electron pair acceptor.<ref name=\"Ebbing\" /> Br\u00f8nsted acid-base reactions are proton transfer reactions while Lewis acid-base reactions are electron pair transfers. Many Lewis acids are not Br\u00f8nsted-Lowry acids. Contrast how the following reactions are described in terms of acid-base chemistry:\n:[[File:LewisAcid.png|374px]]\nIn the first reaction a [[fluoride|fluoride ion]], F<sup>\u2212</sup>, gives up an [[lone pair|electron pair]] to [[boron trifluoride]] to form the product [[tetrafluoroborate]]. Fluoride \"loses\" a pair of [[valence electron]]s because the electrons shared in the B\u2014F bond are located in the region of space between the two atomic [[atomic nucleus|nuclei]] and are therefore more distant from the fluoride nucleus than they are in the lone fluoride ion. BF<sub>3</sub> is a Lewis acid because it accepts the electron pair from fluoride. This reaction cannot be described in terms of Br\u00f8nsted theory because there is no proton transfer. The second reaction can be described using either theory. A proton is transferred from an unspecified Br\u00f8nsted acid to ammonia, a Br\u00f8nsted base; alternatively, ammonia acts as a Lewis base and transfers a lone pair of electrons to form a bond with a hydrogen ion. The species that gains the electron pair is the Lewis acid; for example, the oxygen atom in H<sub>3</sub>O<sup>+</sup> gains a pair of electrons when one of the H\u2014O bonds is broken and the electrons shared in the bond become localized on oxygen. Depending on the context, a Lewis acid may also be described as an [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizer]] or an [[electrophile]]. Organic Br\u00f8nsted acids, such as acetic, citric, or oxalic acid, are not Lewis acids.<ref name=\"Oxtoby8th\" /> They dissociate in water to produce a Lewis acid, H<sup>+</sup>, but at the same time also yield an equal amount of a Lewis base (acetate, citrate, or oxalate, respectively, for the acids mentioned). Few, if any, of the acids discussed in the following are Lewis acids.\n\n==Dissociation and equilibrium==\n<!-- linked from redirect [[Free acid]] -->\nReactions of acids are often generalized in the form HA {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A<sup>\u2212</sup>, where HA represents the acid and A<sup>\u2212</sup> is the [[conjugate acid|conjugate base]]. This reaction is referred to as '''protolysis'''. The protonated form (HA) of an acid is also sometimes referred to as the '''free acid'''.<ref>{{cite book | editor-last1 = Stahl | editor-first1 = P.

Note that the acid can be the charged species and the conjugate base can be neutral in which case the generalized reaction scheme could be written as HA<sup>+</sup> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + A. In solution there exists an [[chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]] between the acid and its conjugate base. The [[equilibrium constant]] ''K'' is an expression of the equilibrium concentrations of the molecules or the ions in solution. Brackets indicate concentration, such that [H<sub>2</sub>O] means ''the concentration of H<sub>2</sub>O''. The [[acid dissociation constant]] ''K''<sub>a</sub> is generally used in the context of acid-base reactions. The numerical value of ''K''<sub>a</sub> is equal to the product of the concentrations of the products divided by the concentration of the reactants, where the reactant is the acid (HA) and the products are the conjugate base and H<sup>+</sup>.\n:<math chem>K_a = \\frac\\ce{[H+] [A^-]}\\ce{[HA]}</math>\nThe stronger of two acids will have a higher ''K''<sub>a</sub> than the weaker acid; the ratio of hydrogen ions to acid will be higher for the stronger acid as the stronger acid has a greater tendency to lose its proton. Because the range of possible values for ''K''<sub>a</sub> spans many orders of magnitude, a more manageable constant, p''K''<sub>a</sub> is more frequently used, where p''K''<sub>a</sub> = &minus;log<sub>10</sub> ''K''<sub>a</sub>. Stronger acids have a smaller p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids. Experimentally determined p''K''<sub>a</sub> at 25&nbsp;\u00b0C in aqueous solution are often quoted in textbooks and reference material.\n\n==Nomenclature==\nIn the classical naming system, acids are named according to their [[anion]]s. That ionic suffix is dropped and replaced with a new suffix (and sometimes prefix), according to the table below.\nFor example, HCl has [[chloride]] as its anion, so the -ide suffix makes it take the form [[hydrochloric acid]]. In the [[IUPAC]] naming system, \"aqueous\" is simply added to the name of the ionic compound. Thus, for hydrogen chloride, the IUPAC name would be aqueous hydrogen chloride. The prefix \"hydro-\" is added only if the acid is made up of just hydrogen and one other element.\n\nClassical naming system:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Anion prefix\n!Anion suffix\n!Acid prefix\n!Acid suffix\n!Example\n|-\n|per\n|ate\n|per\n|ic acid\n|[[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ate\n|\n|ic acid\n|[[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>)\n|-\n|\n|ite\n|\n|ous acid\n|[[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>)\n|-\n|hypo\n|ite\n|hypo\n|ous acid\n|[[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO)\n|-\n|\n|ide\n|hydro\n|ic acid\n|[[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl)\n|}\n\n==Acid strength==\n{{main|Acid strength}}\n\nThe strength of an acid refers to its ability or tendency to lose a proton. A strong acid is one that completely dissociates in water; in other words, one [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a strong acid HA dissolves in water yielding one mole of H<sup>+</sup> and one mole of the conjugate base, A<sup>\u2212</sup>, and none of the protonated acid HA. In contrast, a weak acid only partially dissociates and at equilibrium both the acid and the conjugate base are in solution. Examples of [[strong acid]]s are [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>) and [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>). In water each of these essentially ionizes 100%. The stronger an acid is, the more easily it loses a proton, H<sup>+</sup>. Two key factors that contribute to the ease of deprotonation are the [[chemical polarity|polarity]] of the H\u2014A bond and the size of atom A, which determines the strength of the H\u2014A bond. Acid strengths are also often discussed in terms of the stability of the conjugate base.\n\nStronger acids have a larger ''K''<sub>a</sub> and a more negative p''K''<sub>a</sub> than weaker acids.\n\nSulfonic acids, which are organic oxyacids, are a class of strong acids. A common example is [[toluenesulfonic acid]] (tosylic acid). Unlike sulfuric acid itself, sulfonic acids can be solids. In fact, [[polystyrene]] functionalized into polystyrene sulfonate is a solid strongly acidic plastic that is filterable.\n\n[[Superacid]]s are acids stronger than 100% sulfuric acid. Examples of superacids are [[fluoroantimonic acid]], [[magic acid]] and [[perchloric acid]]. Superacids can permanently protonate water to give ionic, crystalline [[hydronium]] \"salts\". They can also quantitatively stabilize [[carbocation]]s.\n\nWhile ''K''<sub>a</sub> measures the strength of an acid compound, the strength of an aqueous acid solution is measured by pH, which is an indication of the concentration of hydronium in the solution.  The pH of a simple solution of an acid compound in water is determined by the dilution of the compound and the compound's ''K''<sub>a</sub>.\n\n==Chemical characteristics==\n\n===Monoprotic acids===\nMonoprotic acids are those acids that are able to donate one [[proton]] per molecule during the process of [[dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] (sometimes called ionization) as shown below (symbolized by HA):\n:HA<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a</sub>\n\nCommon examples of monoprotic acids in [[mineral acid]]s include [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl) and [[nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>). On the other hand, for [[organic acids]] the term mainly indicates the presence of one [[carboxylic acid]] group and sometimes these acids are known as monocarboxylic acid. Examples in [[organic acids]] include [[formic acid]] (HCOOH), [[acetic acid]] (CH<sub>3</sub>COOH) and [[benzoic acid]] (C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>COOH).\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Monoprotic acids}}\n\n===Polyprotic acids===\nPolyprotic acids, also known as polybasic acids, are able to donate more than one proton per acid molecule, in contrast to monoprotic acids that only donate one proton per molecule. Specific types of polyprotic acids have more specific names, such as diprotic acid (two potential protons to donate) and triprotic acid (three potential protons to donate).\n\nA diprotic acid (here symbolized by H<sub>2</sub>A) can undergo one or two dissociations depending on the pH. Each dissociation has its own dissociation constant, K<sub>a1</sub> and K<sub>a2</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n\nThe first dissociation constant is typically greater than the second; i.e., ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub>. For example, [[sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>) can donate one proton to form the [[bisulfate]] anion (HSO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}), for which ''K''<sub>a1</sub> is very large; then it can donate a second proton to form the [[sulfate]] anion (SO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}), wherein the ''K''<sub>a2</sub> is intermediate strength. The large ''K''<sub>a1</sub> for the first dissociation makes sulfuric a strong acid. In a similar manner, the weak unstable [[carbonic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>) can lose one proton to form [[bicarbonate]] anion (HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}) and lose a second to form [[carbonate]] anion (CO{{su|b=3|p=2\u2212}}). Both ''K''<sub>a</sub> values are small, but ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> .\n\nA triprotic acid (H<sub>3</sub>A) can undergo one, two, or three dissociations and has three dissociation constants, where ''K''<sub>a1</sub> > ''K''<sub>a2</sub> > ''K''<sub>a3</sub>.\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>3</sub>A<sub>(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a1</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|H<sub>2</sub>A{{su|p=\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; ''K''<sub>a2</sub>}}\n:{{nowrap|HA{{su|p=2\u2212|b=(aq)}} + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> {{eqm}} H<sub>3</sub>O{{su|p=+|b=(aq)}} + A{{su|p=3\u2212|b=(aq)}} &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ''K''<sub>a3</sub>}}\n\nAn [[inorganic]] example of a triprotic acid is orthophosphoric acid (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>), usually just called [[phosphoric acid]]. All three protons can be successively lost to yield H<sub>2</sub>PO{{su|b=4|p=\u2212}}, then HPO{{su|b=4|p=2\u2212}}, and finally PO{{su|b=4|p=3\u2212}}, the orthophosphate ion, usually just called [[phosphate]]. Even though the positions of the three protons on the original phosphoric acid molecule are equivalent, the successive ''K''<sub>a</sub> values differ since it is energetically less favorable to lose a proton if the conjugate base is more negatively charged. An [[organic compound|organic]] example of a triprotic acid is [[citric acid]], which can successively lose three protons to finally form the [[citrate]] ion.\n\nAlthough the subsequent loss of each hydrogen ion is less favorable, all of the conjugate bases are present in solution. The fractional concentration, ''\u03b1'' (alpha), for each species can be calculated. For example, a generic diprotic acid will generate 3 species in solution: H<sub>2</sub>A, HA<sup>\u2212</sup>, and A<sup>2\u2212</sup>. The fractional concentrations can be calculated as below when given either the pH (which can be converted to the [H<sup>+</sup>]) or the concentrations of the acid with all its conjugate bases:\n:<math chem>\\begin{align}\n\\alpha_\\ce{H2A}    &= \\frac\\ce{[H+]^2}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}     = \\frac\\ce{[H2A]}\\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\\\\n\\alpha_\\ce{HA^-}   &= \\frac{[\\ce{H+}]K_1}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2} = \\frac\\ce{[HA^-]}\\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\\\\n\\alpha_\\ce{A^{2-}} &= \\frac{K_1 K_2}{\\ce{[H+]^2} + [\\ce{H+}]K_1 + K_1 K_2}      = \\frac\\ce{[A^{2-}]}\\ce{{[H2A]}+{[HA^-]}+{[A^{2-}]}}\n\\end{align}</math>\nA plot of these fractional concentrations against pH, for given ''K''<sub>1</sub> and ''K''<sub>2</sub>, is known as a [[Bjerrum plot]]. A pattern is observed in the above equations and can be expanded to the general ''n'' -protic acid that has been deprotonated ''i'' -times:\n:<math chem>\n\\alpha_{\\ce H_{n-i} A^{i-} }= {{[\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\over { \\displaystyle \\sum_{i=0}^n \\Big[ [\\ce{H+}]^{n-i} \\displaystyle \\prod_{j=0}^{i}K_j} \\Big] }\n</math>\n\nwhere ''K''<sub>0</sub> = 1 and the other K-terms are the dissociation constants for the acid.\n{{See also|Acid dissociation constant#Polyprotic acids}}\n\n===Neutralization===\n[[Image:Hydrochloric acid ammonia.jpg|thumb|[[Hydrochloric acid]] (in [[beaker (glassware)|beaker]]) reacting with [[ammonia]] fumes to produce [[ammonium chloride]] (white smoke).]]\n[[Neutralization (chemistry)|Neutralization]] is the reaction between an acid and a base, producing a [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] and neutralized base; for example, [[hydrochloric acid]] and [[sodium hydroxide]] form [[sodium chloride]] and water:\n:HCl<sub>(aq)</sub> + NaOH<sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub> + NaCl<sub>(aq)</sub>\n\nNeutralization is the basis of [[titration]], where a [[pH indicator]] shows equivalence point when the equivalent number of moles of a base have been added to an acid. It is often wrongly assumed that neutralization should result in a solution with pH 7.0, which is only the case with similar acid and base strengths during a reaction.\n\nNeutralization with a base weaker than the acid results in a weakly acidic salt. An example is the weakly acidic [[ammonium chloride]], which is produced from the strong acid [[hydrogen chloride]] and the weak base [[ammonia]]. Conversely, neutralizing a weak acid with a strong base gives a weakly basic salt, e.g. [[sodium fluoride]] from [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[sodium hydroxide]].\n\n===Weak acid\u2013weak base equilibrium===\n{{main|Henderson\u2013Hasselbalch equation}}\nIn order for a protonated acid to lose a proton, the pH of the system must rise above the p''K''<sub>a</sub> of the acid. The decreased concentration of H<sup>+</sup> in that basic solution shifts the equilibrium towards the conjugate base form (the deprotonated form of the acid). In lower-pH (more acidic) solutions, there is a high enough H<sup>+</sup> concentration in the solution to cause the acid to remain in its protonated form.\n\nSolutions of weak acids and salts of their conjugate bases form [[buffer solution]]s.\n\n==Applications of acids==\nThere are numerous uses for acids. Acids are often used to remove rust and other corrosion from metals in a process known as [[pickling (metal)|pickling]]. They may be used as an electrolyte in a [[wet cell battery]], such as [[sulfuric acid]] in a [[car battery]].\n\nStrong acids, sulfuric acid in particular, are widely used in mineral processing. For example, phosphate minerals react with sulfuric acid to produce [[phosphoric acid]] for the production of phosphate fertilizers, and [[zinc]] is produced by dissolving zinc oxide into sulfuric acid, purifying the solution and electrowinning.\n\nIn the chemical industry, acids react in neutralization reactions to produce salts. For example, [[nitric acid]] reacts with [[ammonia]] to produce [[ammonium nitrate]], a fertilizer. Additionally, [[carboxylic acid]]s can be [[Esterification|esterified]] with alcohols, to produce [[ester]]s.\n\nAcids are used as additives to drinks and foods, as they alter their taste and serve as preservatives. [[Phosphoric acid]], for example, is a component of [[cola]] drinks. Acetic acid is used in day-to-day life as vinegar. Carbonic acid is an important part of some cola drinks and soda.  Citric acid is used as a preservative in sauces and pickles.\n\n[[Tartaric acid]] is an important component of some commonly used foods like unripened mangoes and tamarind. Natural fruits and vegetables also contain acids. [[Citric acid]] is present in oranges, lemon and other citrus fruits. [[Oxalic acid]] is present in tomatoes, spinach, and especially in [[carambola]] and [[rhubarb]]; rhubarb leaves and unripe carambolas are toxic because of high concentrations of oxalic acid.\n\n[[Ascorbic acid]] (Vitamin C) is an essential vitamin for the human body and is present in such foods as amla ([[Phyllanthus emblica|Indian gooseberry]]), lemon, citrus fruits, and guava.\n\nCertain acids are used as drugs. [[Acetylsalicylic acid]] (Aspirin) is used as a pain killer and for bringing down fevers.\n\nAcids play important roles in the human body. The hydrochloric acid present in the stomach aids in digestion by breaking down large and complex food molecules. Amino acids are required for synthesis of proteins required for growth and repair of body tissues. Fatty acids are also required for growth and repair of body tissues. Nucleic acids are important for the manufacturing of DNA and RNA and transmitting of traits to offspring through genes. Carbonic acid is important for maintenance of pH equilibrium in the body.\n\n===Acid catalysis===\n{{Main|Acid catalysis}}\nAcids are used as [[catalyst]]s in industrial and organic chemistry; for example, [[sulfuric acid]] is used in very large quantities in the [[alkylation]] process to produce gasoline. Strong acids, such as sulfuric, phosphoric and hydrochloric acids also effect [[Dehydration reaction|dehydration]] and [[condensation reaction]]s. In biochemistry, many [[enzyme]]s employ acid catalysis.<ref name=\"Voet acid cat\">{{cite book |author=Voet, Judith G.|author2=Voet, Donald |title=Biochemistry |publisher=J.

[[Nucleic acid]]s, which contain acidic [[phosphate|phosphate groups]], include [[DNA]] and [[RNA]]. Nucleic acids contain the genetic code that determines many of an organism's characteristics, and is passed from parents to offspring. DNA contains the chemical blueprint for the synthesis of [[protein]]s which are made up of [[amino acid]] subunits. [[Cell membrane]]s contain [[fatty acid]] [[ester]]s such as [[phospholipids]].\n\nAn \u03b1-amino acid has a central carbon (the \u03b1 or [[alpha and beta carbon|''alpha'' carbon]]) which is covalently bonded to a [[carboxyl]] group (thus they are [[carboxylic acid]]s), an [[amine|amino]] group, a hydrogen atom and a variable group. The variable group, also called the R group or side chain, determines the identity and many of the properties of a specific amino acid. In [[glycine]], the simplest amino acid, the R group is a hydrogen atom, but in all other amino acids it is contains one or more carbon atoms bonded to hydrogens, and may contain other elements such as sulfur, oxygen or nitrogen. With the exception of glycine, naturally occurring amino acids are [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] and almost invariably occur in the [[Chirality (chemistry)#By configuration: D- and L-|<small>L</small>-configuration]]. [[Peptidoglycan]], found in some bacterial [[cell wall]]s contains some <small>D</small>-amino acids. At physiological pH, typically around 7, free amino acids exist in a charged form, where the acidic carboxyl group (-COOH) loses a proton (-COO<sup>\u2212</sup>) and the basic amine group (-NH<sub>2</sub>) gains a proton (-NH{{su|b=3|p=+}}). The entire molecule has a net neutral charge and is a [[zwitterion]], with the exception of amino acids with basic or acidic side chains. [[Aspartic acid]], for example, possesses one protonated amine and two deprotonated carboxyl groups, for a net charge of \u22121 at physiological pH.\n\nFatty acids and fatty acid derivatives are another group of carboxylic acids that play a significant role in biology. These contain long hydrocarbon chains and a carboxylic acid group on one end. The cell membrane of nearly all organisms is primarily made up of a [[phospholipid bilayer]], a [[micelle]] of hydrophobic fatty acid esters with polar, hydrophilic [[phosphate]] \"head\" groups. Membranes contain additional components, some of which can participate in acid-base reactions.\n\nIn humans and many other animals, [[hydrochloric acid]] is a part of the [[gastric acid]] secreted within the [[stomach]] to help hydrolyze [[protein]]s and [[polysaccharide]]s, as well as converting the inactive pro-enzyme, [[pepsinogen]] into the [[digestive enzyme|enzyme]], [[pepsin]]. Some organisms produce acids for defense; for example, ants produce [[formic acid]].\n\nAcid-base equilibrium plays a critical role in regulating [[mammal]]ian breathing. [[molecular oxygen|Oxygen]] gas (O<sub>2</sub>) drives [[cellular respiration]], the process by which animals release the chemical [[potential energy]] stored in food, producing [[carbon dioxide]] (CO<sub>2</sub>) as a byproduct. Oxygen and carbon dioxide are exchanged in the [[lungs]], and the body responds to changing energy demands by adjusting the rate of [[ventilation (physiology)|ventilation]]. For example, during periods of exertion the body rapidly breaks down stored [[carbohydrate]]s and fat, releasing CO<sub>2</sub> into the blood stream. In aqueous solutions such as blood CO<sub>2</sub> exists in equilibrium with [[carbonic acid]] and [[bicarbonate]] ion.\n: CO<sub>2</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O {{eqm}} H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> {{eqm}} H<sup>+</sup> + HCO{{su|b=3|p=\u2212}}\nIt is the decrease in pH that signals the brain to breathe faster and deeper, expelling the excess CO<sub>2</sub> and resupplying the cells with O<sub>2</sub>.\n\n[[Image:Aspirin-skeletal.svg|thumb|right|[[Aspirin]] (acetylsalicylic acid) is a [[carboxylic acid]].]] [[Cell membrane]]s are generally impermeable to charged or large, polar molecules because of the [[lipophilicity|lipophilic]] fatty acyl chains comprising their interior. Many biologically important molecules, including a number of pharmaceutical agents, are organic weak acids which can cross the membrane in their protonated, uncharged form but not in their charged form (i.e. as the conjugate base). For this reason the activity of many drugs can be enhanced or inhibited by the use of antacids or acidic foods. The charged form, however, is often more soluble in blood and [[cytosol]], both aqueous environments. When the extracellular environment is more acidic than the neutral pH within the cell, certain acids will exist in their neutral form and will be membrane soluble, allowing them to cross the phospholipid bilayer. Acids that lose a proton at the [[intracellular pH]] will exist in their soluble, charged form and are thus able to diffuse through the cytosol to their target. [[Ibuprofen]], [[aspirin]] and [[penicillin]] are examples of drugs that are weak acids.\n\n==Common acids==\n\n===Mineral acids (inorganic acids)===\n* [[Hydrogen halides]] and their solutions: [[hydrofluoric acid]] (HF), [[hydrochloric acid]] (HCl), [[hydrobromic acid]] (HBr), [[hydroiodic acid]] (HI)\n* Halogen oxoacids: [[hypochlorous acid]] (HClO), [[chlorous acid]] (HClO<sub>2</sub>), [[chloric acid]] (HClO<sub>3</sub>), [[perchloric acid]] (HClO<sub>4</sub>), and corresponding analogs for bromine and iodine\n** [[Hypofluorous acid]] (HFO), the only known oxoacid for fluorine.\n* [[Sulfuric acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluorosulfuric acid]] (HSO<sub>3</sub>F)\n* [[Nitric acid]] (HNO<sub>3</sub>)\n* [[Phosphoric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroantimonic acid]] (HSbF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Fluoroboric acid]] (HBF<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Hexafluorophosphoric acid]] (HPF<sub>6</sub>)\n* [[Chromic acid]] (H<sub>2</sub>CrO<sub>4</sub>)\n* [[Boric acid]] (H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>)\n\n===Sulfonic acids===\nA [[sulfonic acid]] has the general formula RS(=O)<sub>2</sub>\u2013OH, where R is an organic radical.\n* [[Methanesulfonic acid]] (or mesylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Ethanesulfonic acid]] (or esylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>CH<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Benzenesulfonic acid]] (or besylic acid, C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>5</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[p-Toluenesulfonic acid]] (or tosylic acid, CH<sub>3</sub>C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Trifluoromethanesulfonic acid]] (or triflic acid, CF<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H)\n* [[Polystyrene sulfonic acid]] (sulfonated [[polystyrene]], [CH<sub>2</sub>CH(C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>4</sub>)SO<sub>3</sub>H]<sub>n</sub>)\n\n===Carboxylic acids===\nA [[carboxylic acid]] has the general formula R-C(O)OH, where R is an organic radical.

In French, the term ''asphalte'' is used for naturally occurring asphalt-soaked limestone deposits, and for specialised manufactured products with fewer voids or greater bitumen content than the \"asphaltic concrete\" used to pave roads. \n\nThe expression \"bitumen\" originated in the [[Sanskrit]] words ''jatu'', meaning \"pitch,\" and ''jatu-krit'', meaning \"pitch creating\" or \"pitch producing\" (referring to [[coniferous]] or resinous trees). The Latin equivalent is claimed by some to be originally ''gwitu-men'' (pertaining to pitch), and by others, ''pixtumens'' (exuding or bubbling pitch), which was subsequently shortened to ''bitumen'', thence passing via French into English.

During the early and mid-20th century, when [[town gas]] was produced, coal tar was a readily available byproduct and extensively used as the binder for road aggregates. The addition of coal tar to [[macadam]] roads led to the word \"[[tarmac]]\", which is now used in common parlance to refer to road-making materials. However, since the 1970s, when natural gas succeeded town gas, asphalt has completely overtaken the use of coal tar in these applications. Other examples of this confusion include the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] and the Canadian [[oil sands]], both of which actually contain natural bitumen rather than tar. \"Pitch\" is another term sometimes informally used at times to refer to asphalt, as in [[Pitch Lake]].\n\n==Occurrence==\n[[File:Puy de Poix, gisement bitumeux.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Bituminous outcrop of the Puy de la Poix, [[Clermont-Ferrand]], France]]\nThe majority of asphalt used commercially is obtained from petroleum.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PtMVBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA82&dq=The+majority+of+asphalt+used+commercially+is+obtained+from+petroleum.&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiy9Iu-n9_UAhVTzmMKHUHtAyUQ6AEIJDAA#v=onepage&q=The%20majority%20of%20asphalt%20used%20commercially%20is%20obtained%20from%20petroleum.&f=false|title=Asphalt Materials Science and Technology|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2015-10-01|publisher=Butterworth-Heinemann|isbn=9780128005019|language=en}}</ref> Nonetheless, large amounts of asphalt occur in concentrated form in nature. Naturally occurring deposits of bitumen are formed from the remains of ancient, microscopic [[algae]] ([[diatom]]s) and other once-living things.

Under the heat (above 50&nbsp;\u00b0C) and [[pressure]] of burial deep in the earth, the remains were transformed into materials such as bitumen, [[kerogen]], or petroleum.\n\nNatural deposits of bitumen include lakes such as the [[Pitch Lake]] in Trinidad and Tobago and [[Lake Bermudez]] in [[Venezuela]].

The nearest town, [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]], was a small fur trading post, other markets were far away, and transportation costs were too high to ship the raw bituminous sand for paving. In 1915, Sidney Ells of the Federal Mines Branch experimented with separation techniques and used the product to pave 600 feet of road in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. Other roads in Alberta were paved with material extracted from oil sands, but it was generally not economic. During the 1920s [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl A. Clark]] of the [[Alberta Research Council]] patented a hot water oil separation process and entrepreneur Robert C. Fitzsimmons<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.canadianpetroleumhalloffame.ca/robert-fitzsimmons.html | title = Robert C.

In 1826 or 1827, it was used by French scientist [[Joseph Nic\u00e9phore Ni\u00e9pce]] to make the [[View from the Window at Le Gras|oldest surviving photograph from nature]]. The bitumen was thinly coated onto a [[pewter]] plate which was then exposed in a camera. Exposure to light hardened the bitumen and made it insoluble, so that when it was subsequently rinsed with a solvent only the sufficiently light-struck areas remained. Many hours of exposure in the camera were required, making bitumen impractical for ordinary photography, but from the 1850s to the 1920s it was in common use as a [[photoresist]] in the production of printing plates for various photomechanical printing processes.<ref>[http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html Ni\u00e9pce Museum history pages.] Retrieved 27 October 2012. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070803222723/http://www.niepce.org/pagus/pagus-inv.html |date=3 August 2007 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.hrc.utexas.edu/exhibitions/permanent/wfp/ The First Photograph (Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin).] Retrieved 27 October 2012.</ref>\n\nBitumen was the nemesis of many artists during the 19th century. Although widely used for a time, it ultimately proved unstable for use in oil painting, especially when mixed with the most common diluents, such as linseed oil, varnish and turpentine. Unless thoroughly diluted, bitumen never fully solidifies and will in time corrupt the other pigments with which it comes into contact. The use of bitumen as a glaze to set in shadow or mixed with other colors to render a darker tone resulted in the eventual deterioration of many paintings, for instance those of [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]. Perhaps the most famous example of the destructiveness of bitumen is [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s [[Raft of the Medusa]] (1818\u20131819), where his use of bitumen caused the brilliant colors to degenerate into dark greens and blacks and the paint and canvas to buckle.<ref name=\"WSJ 2009-08-21\">{{cite news |last=Spiegelman |first=Willard |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204119704574236393080650258 |title=Revolutionary Romanticism: 'The Raft of the Medusa' brought energy to French art |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |location=New York City |date=2009-08-21 |accessdate=2016-01-27 }}</ref>\n\n==Modern use==\n\n=== Global use ===\nThe vast majority of refined asphalt is used in construction: primarily as a constituent of products used in paving and roofing applications. According to the requirements of the end use, asphalt is produced to specification. This is achieved either by refining or blending. It is estimated that the current world use of asphalt is approximately 102 million tonnes per year. Approximately 85% of all the asphalt produced is used as the [[Binder (material)|binder]] in asphalt concrete for roads. It is also used in other paved areas such as airport runways, car parks and footways. Typically, the production of asphalt concrete involves mixing fine and coarse [[Construction aggregate|aggregates]] such as [[sand]], [[gravel]] and crushed rock with asphalt, which acts as the binding agent. Other materials, such as recycled polymers (e.g., [[Natural rubber|rubber]] [[tire|tyres]]), may be added to the asphalt to modify its properties according to the application for which the asphalt is ultimately intended.\n  \nA further 10% of global asphalt production is used in roofing applications, where its waterproofing qualities are invaluable.\nThe remaining 5% of asphalt is used mainly for sealing and insulating purposes in a variety of building materials, such as pipe coatings, carpet tile backing and paint.\nAsphalt is applied in the construction and maintenance of many structures, systems, and components, such as the following:\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* Highways\n* Airport runways\n* Footways and pedestrian ways\n* Car parks\n* Racetracks\n* Tennis courts\n* Roofing\n* Damp proofing\n* Dams\n* Reservoir and pool linings\n* Soundproofing\n* Pipe coatings\n* Cable coatings\n* Paints\n* Building water proofing\n* Tile underlying waterproofing\n* Newspaper ink production\n* and many other applications\n{{colend}}\n\n=== Rolled asphalt concrete ===\n{{main article|Asphalt concrete}}The largest use of asphalt is for making [[asphalt concrete]] for road surfaces; this accounts for approximately 85% of the asphalt consumed in the United States. Asphalt concrete pavement mixes are typically composed of 5% asphalt cement and 95% aggregates (stone, sand, and gravel). Due to its highly viscous nature, asphalt cement must be heated so it can be mixed with the aggregates at the asphalt mixing facility. The temperature required varies depending upon characteristics of the asphalt and the aggregates, but [[Asphalt concrete#Mixture formulations|warm-mix asphalt technologies]] allow producers to reduce the temperature required. There are about 4,000 asphalt concrete mixing plants in the US, and a similar number in Europe.<ref>{{cite book | title = The Asphalt Paving Industry: A Global Perspective, 2nd Edition | publisher = National Asphalt Pavement Association and European Asphalt Pavement Association | date = February 2011  | location = Lanham, Maryland, and Brussels | url = http://www.asphaltpavement.org/images/stories/GL_101_Edition_3.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 27 September 2012 | isbn = 0-914313-06-1}}</ref>\n\nWhen maintenance is performed on asphalt pavements, such as [[Pavement milling|milling]] to remove a worn or damaged surface, the removed material can be returned to a facility for processing into new pavement mixtures. The asphalt in the removed material can be reactivated and put back to use in new pavement mixes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=How Should We Express RAP and RAS Contents? |journal=Asphalt Technology E-News |year=2014 |authorlink=National Center for Asphalt Technology |volume=26 |issue=2 |url=http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/info-pubs/newsletters/fall-2014/recycledcontents.html |accessdate=2015-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150609020500/http://www.eng.auburn.edu/research/centers/ncat/info-pubs/newsletters/fall-2014/recycledcontents.html |archivedate=9 June 2015 |df= }}</ref> With some 95% of paved roads being constructed of or surfaced with asphalt,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/statistics/2012/hm12.cfm |title=Highway Statistics Series: Public Road Length Miles by Type of Surface and Ownership |publisher=[[Federal Highway Administration]] |date=2013-10-01 |accessdate=2015-08-13 }}</ref> a substantial amount of asphalt pavement material is reclaimed each year.

Due to the sturdiness and ability to be repaired quickly, it is widely used for [[Runway|runways]].\n\n=== Mastic asphalt ===\n{{further|Fibre mastic asphalt}}\n[[Mastic asphalt]] is a type of asphalt that differs from dense graded asphalt ([[asphalt concrete]]) in that it has a higher asphalt ([[binder (material)|binder]]) content, usually around 7\u201310% of the whole aggregate mix, as opposed to rolled asphalt concrete, which has only around 5% asphalt. This thermoplastic substance is widely used in the building industry for waterproofing flat roofs and tanking underground. Mastic asphalt is heated to a temperature of {{convert|210|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} and is spread in layers to form an impervious barrier about {{convert|20|mm|in|abbr=off|sp=us}} thick.\n\n=== Asphalt emulsion ===\nA number of technologies allow asphalt to be mixed at much lower temperatures. These involve mixing with petroleum solvents to form \"cutbacks\" with reduced melting point or mixing with water to turn the asphalt into an [[emulsion]]. Asphalt emulsions contain up to 70% asphalt and typically less than 1.5% chemical additives. There are two main types of emulsions with different affinity for aggregates, [[cationic]] and [[anionic]]. Asphalt emulsions are used in a wide variety of applications. [[Chipseal]] involves spraying the road surface with asphalt emulsion followed by a layer of crushed rock, gravel or crushed slag. Slurry seal involves the creation of a mixture of asphalt emulsion and fine crushed aggregate that is spread on the surface of a road. Cold-mixed asphalt can also be made from asphalt emulsion to create pavements similar to hot-mixed asphalt, several inches in depth, and asphalt emulsions are also blended into recycled hot-mix asphalt to create low-cost pavements.\n\n=== Synthetic crude oil ===\n{{main article|Synthetic crude oil}}\n{{see also|Petroleum production in Canada}}\nSynthetic crude oil, also known as syncrude, is the output from a bitumen upgrader facility used in connection with oil sand production in Canada. Bituminous sands are mined using enormous (100 ton capacity) [[power shovel]]s and loaded into even larger (400 ton capacity) [[dump trucks]] for movement to an upgrading facility. The process used to extract the bitumen from the sand is a hot water process originally developed by [[Karl Clark (chemist)|Dr. Karl Clark]] of the [[University of Alberta]] during the 1920s. After extraction from the sand, the bitumen is fed into a [[Upgrader|bitumen upgrader]] which converts it into a [[light crude oil]] equivalent. This synthetic substance is fluid enough to be transferred through conventional [[oil pipeline]]s and can be fed into conventional oil refineries without any further treatment. By 2015 Canadian bitumen upgraders were producing over {{convert|1|Moilbbl}} per day of synthetic crude oil, of which 75% was exported to oil refineries in the United States.<ref name=NEBstats>{{Cite web | url = https://www.neb-one.gc.ca/nrg/sttstc/crdlndptrlmprdct/index-eng.html | title = Crude Oil and Petroleum Products | publisher  = [[National Energy Board]] of Canada | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn Alberta, five bitumen upgraders produce synthetic crude oil and a variety of other products: The [[Suncor Energy]] upgrader near [[Fort McMurray, Alberta]] produces synthetic crude oil plus diesel fuel; the [[Syncrude Canada]], [[Canadian Natural Resources]], and [[Nexen]] upgraders near Fort McMurray produce synthetic crude oil; and the Shell [[Scotford Upgrader]] near Edmonton produces synthetic crude oil plus an intermediate feedstock for the nearby Shell Oil Refinery.<ref name=CAPP2015>{{Cite web|url=http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |title=2015 CAPP Crude Oil Forecast, Markets & Transportation |publisher=[[Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers]] |accessdate=January 21, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160120081514/http://www.capp.ca/publications-and-statistics/publications/264673 |archivedate=20 January 2016 |df= }}</ref> A sixth upgrader, under construction in 2015 near [[Redwater, Alberta]], will upgrade half of its crude bitumen directly to diesel fuel, with the remainder of the output being sold as feedstock to nearby oil refineries and petrochemical plants.<ref>{{Cite web | url = http://www.nwrpartnership.com/ | title = The Project | publisher = North West Redwater Partnership | accessdate = January 21, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Non-upgraded crude bitumen ===\n{{See also|Western Canadian Select}}\nCanadian bitumen does not differ substantially from oils such as Venezuelan extra-heavy and Mexican [[heavy crude oil|heavy oil]] in chemical composition, and the real difficulty is moving the extremely viscous bitumen through [[oil pipeline]]s to the refinery. Many modern oil refineries are extremely sophisticated and can process non-upgraded bitumen directly into products such as gasoline, diesel fuel, and refined asphalt without any preprocessing. This is particularly common in areas such as the US [[Gulf coast]], where refineries were designed to process Venezuelan and Mexican oil, and in areas such as the US [[Midwest]] where refineries were rebuilt to process heavy oil as domestic light oil production declined. Given the choice, such heavy oil refineries usually prefer to buy bitumen rather than synthetic oil because the cost is lower, and in some cases because they prefer to produce more diesel fuel and less gasoline.<ref name=CAPP2015/> By 2015 Canadian production and exports of non-upgraded bitumen exceeded that of synthetic crude oil at over {{convert|1.3|Moilbbl}} per day, of which about 65% was exported to the United States.<ref name=NEBstats/>\n\nBecause of the difficulty of moving crude bitumen through pipelines, non-upgraded bitumen is usually diluted with [[natural-gas condensate]] in a form called [[dilbit]] or with synthetic crude oil, called [[synbit]]. However, to meet international competition, much non-upgraded bitumen is now sold as a blend of multiple grades of bitumen, conventional crude oil, synthetic crude oil, and condensate in a standardized benchmark product such as [[Western Canadian Select]]. This sour, heavy crude oil blend is designed to have uniform refining characteristics to compete with internationally marketed heavy oils such as [[Petroleum industry in Mexico|Mexican Mayan]] or Arabian [[Dubai Crude]].<ref name=CAPP2015/>\n\n===Radioactive waste encapsulation matrix===\n\nAsphalt was used starting in the 1960s as an [[hydrophobic]] matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble [[sodium nitrate]] and [[sodium sulfate]]) produced by the reprocessing of [[spent nuclear fuel]]s or radioactive [[sludge]]s from sedimentation ponds.<ref>Rodier, J., Scheidhauer, J., & Malabre, M.

One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation because of the presence of [[hydrogen]] gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma [[radiolysis]].<ref>Johnson, D.I., Hitchon, J.W., & Phillips, D.C. (1986). Further observations of the swelling of bitumens and simulated bitumen wasteforms during \u03b3-irradiation (No. AERE-R\u201412292). UKAEA Harwell Lab.

Journal of nuclear materials, 125(2), 202-218.</ref> A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated [[hygroscopic]] salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for [[osmosis|osmotic]] effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a [[Semipermeable membrane|semi-permeable membrane]]. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high [[ionic strength]] of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the [[redox]] conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as [[selenium]], [[technetium]], [[uranium]], [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]] have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded [[anion]]s. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.\n\nDifferent type of asphalt have been used: blown bitumen (partly oxidized with air oxygen at high temperature after distillation, and harder) and direct distillation bitumen (softer). Blown bitumens like Mexphalte, with a high content of saturated hydrocarbons, are more easily biodegraded by microorganisms than direct distillation bitumen, with a low content of saturated hydrocarbons and a high content of aromatic hydrocarbons.<ref>Ait-Langomazino, N., Sellier, R., Jouquet, G., & Trescinski, M. (1991). Microbial degradation of bitumen. Experientia, 47(6), 533-539.</ref>\n\nConcrete encapsulation of radwaste is presently considered a safer alternative by the [[nuclear industry]] and the waste management organisations.\n\n===Other uses===\n[[Asphalt shingle|Roofing shingle]]s account for most of the remaining asphalt consumption. Other uses include cattle sprays, fence-post treatments, and waterproofing for fabrics. Asphalt is used to make [[Japan black]], a [[lacquer]] known especially for its use on iron and steel, and it is also used in paint and marker inks by some exterior paint supply companies to increase the weather resistance and permanence of the paint or ink, and to make the color darker.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Asphalt is also used to seal some alkaline batteries during the manufacturing process.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Asphalt plant pic.jpg|thumbnail|right|Typical asphalt plant for making asphalt]]\nAbout 40,000,000 tons were produced in 1984{{update inline|date=June 2014}}. It is obtained as the \"heavy\" (i.e., difficult to distill) fraction. Material with a [[boiling point]] greater than around 500&nbsp;\u00b0C is considered asphalt. Vacuum distillation separates it from the other components in crude oil (such as [[naphtha]], gasoline and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]]). The resulting material is typically further treated to extract small but valuable amounts of lubricants and to adjust the properties of the material to suit applications. In a [[de-asphalting unit]], the crude asphalt is treated with either [[propane]] or [[butane]] in a [[Supercritical fluid|supercritical]] phase to extract the lighter molecules, which are then separated. Further processing is possible by \"blowing\" the product: namely reacting it with [[oxygen]]. This step makes the product harder and more viscous.<ref name=Ullmann/>\n\nAsphalt is typically stored and transported at temperatures around {{convert|150|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}. Sometimes [[diesel oil]] or [[kerosene]] are mixed in before shipping to retain liquidity; upon delivery, these lighter materials are separated out of the mixture. This mixture is often called \"bitumen feedstock\", or BFS. Some [[dump truck]]s route the hot engine exhaust through pipes in the dump body to keep the material warm. The backs of tippers carrying asphalt, as well as some handling equipment, are also commonly sprayed with a releasing agent before filling to aid release. Diesel oil is no longer used as a [[release agent]] due to environmental concerns.\n\n===Oil sands===\n{{main|Oil sands}}\nNaturally occurring crude bitumen impregnated in sedimentary rock is the prime feed stock for petroleum production from \"[[oil sands]]\", currently under development in Alberta, Canada. Canada has most of the world's supply of natural bitumen, covering 140,000 square kilometres<ref name=oilsands/> (an area larger than England), giving it the second-largest proven [[oil reserves]] in the world. The [[Athabasca oil sands]] are the largest bitumen deposit in Canada and the only one accessible to [[surface mining]], although recent technological breakthroughs have resulted in deeper deposits becoming producible by ''[[in-situ#Petroleum|in situ]]'' methods. Because of [[world oil market chronology from 2003|oil price increases after 2003]], producing bitumen became highly profitable, but as a result of the decline after 2014 it became uneconomic to build new plants again. By 2014, Canadian crude bitumen production averaged about {{convert|2.3|Moilbbl|m3}} per day and was projected to rise to {{convert|4.4|Moilbbl|m3}} per day by 2020.<ref name=\"CAPP\"/> The total amount of crude bitumen in Alberta that could be extracted is estimated to be about {{convert|310|Goilbbl|e9m3|sigfig=1}},<ref name=ST98/> which at a rate of {{convert|4400000|oilbbl/d}} would last about 200 years.\n\n===Alternatives and bioasphalt ===\n{{Main article|Peak oil|Global warming|Bioasphalt}}\nAlthough uncompetitive economically, asphalt can be made from nonpetroleum-based renewable resources such as sugar, [[molasses]] and rice, corn and potato [[starch]]es. Asphalt can also be made from waste material by [[fractional distillation]] of used [[motor oil]], which is sometimes otherwise disposed of by burning or dumping into landfills. Use of motor oil may cause premature cracking in colder climates, resulting in roads that need to be repaved more frequently.<ref>{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/10298436.2010.488729| issn = 1029-8436| volume = 11| issue = 6| pages = 541\u2013553| last = Hesp| first = Simon A.M.|author2=Herbert F.

The bitumen is found in the form of veins, filling cracks in a more or less horizontal direction. The bitumen content varies from 83% to 92% (soluble in carbon disulphide), with a penetration value near to zero and a softening point (ring and ball) around 120&nbsp;\u00b0C. The insoluble matter, consisting mainly of silica ore, ranges from 8% to 17%.\n \nAlbanian bitumen extraction has a long history and was practiced in an organized way by the Romans. After centuries of silence, the first mentions of Albanian bitumen appeared only in 1868, when the Frenchman [[Henri Coquand|Coquand]] published the first geological description of the deposits of Albanian bitumen. In 1875, the exploitation rights were granted to the Ottoman government and in 1912, they were transferred to the Italian company Simsa. Since 1945, the mine was exploited by the Albanian government and from 2001 to date, the management passed to a French company, which organized the mining process for the manufacture of the natural bitumen on an industrial scale.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Giavarini|first1=Carlo|title=Six Thousand Years of Asphalt|date=March 2013|publisher=SITEB|isbn=978-88-908408-3-8|pages=71\u201378}}</ref>\n\nToday the mine is predominantly exploited in an open pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in granular form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine.\n \nSelenizza<ref name=\"Selenice Bitumi\">[http://www.selenicebitumi.com/engindex.php], Selenice Bitumi for more information about Selenizza</ref> is mainly used as an additive in the road construction sector. It is mixed with traditional asphalt to improve both the viscoelastic properties and the resistance to ageing. It may be blended with the hot asphalt in tanks, but its granular form allows it to be fed in the mixer or in the recycling ring of normal asphalt plants. Other typical applications include the production of mastic asphalts for sidewalks, bridges, car-parks and urban roads as well as drilling fluid additives for the oil and gas industry. Selenizza is available in powder or in granular material of various particle sizes and is packaged in sacks or in thermal fusible polyethylene bags.\n\nA [[life-cycle assessment]] study of the natural selenizza compared with petroleum asphalt has shown that the environmental impact of the selenizza  is about half the impact of the road asphalt produced in oil refineries in terms of carbon dioxide emission.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Giavarini|first1=C.|last2=Pellegrini|first2=A.|title=Life cycle assessment of Selenice asphalt compared with petroleum bitumen|journal=The 1st Albanian Congress on Roads|pages=234\u2013237}}</ref>\n\n== Health and safety ==\nPeople can be exposed to asphalt in the workplace by breathing in fumes or skin absorption.

These standards ensure that the characteristics and performance of products are consistent, that people use the same definitions and terms, and that products are tested the same way. ANSI also accredits organizations that carry out product or personnel certification in accordance with requirements defined in international standards.<ref>ANSI 2009 Annual Report</ref>\n\nThe organization's headquarters are in [[Washington, D.C.]]  ANSI's operations office is located in [[New York City]]. The ANSI annual operating budget is funded by the sale of publications, membership dues and fees, accreditation services, fee-based programs, and international standards programs.\n\n== History ==\nANSI was originally formed in 1918, when five engineering societies and three government agencies founded the '''American Engineering Standards Committee''' ('''AESC''').<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/history.aspx|title=ANSI: Historical Overview|website=ansi.org|access-date=2016-10-31}}</ref> In 1928, the AESC became the '''American Standards Association''' ('''ASA'''). In 1966, the ASA was reorganized and became  '''United States of America Standards Institute''' ('''USASI'''). The present name was adopted in 1969.\n\nPrior to 1918, these five founding engineering societies:\n*[[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]] (AIEE, now [[IEEE]])\n*[[American Society of Mechanical Engineers]] (ASME)\n*[[American Society of Civil Engineers]] (ASCE)\n*American Institute of Mining Engineers (AIME, now [[American Institute of Mining, Metallurgical, and Petroleum Engineers]])\n*American Society for Testing and Materials (now [[ASTM International]])\nhad been members of the United Engineering Society (UES). At the behest of the AIEE, they invited the U.S. government Departments of War, Navy (combined in 1947 to become the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] or DOD) and Commerce<ref>[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/history.aspx?menuid=1 ANSI history]- Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref> to join in founding a national standards organization.\n\nAccording to Adam Stanton, the first permanent secretary and head of staff in 1919, AESC started as an ambitious program and little else.  Staff for the first year consisted of one executive, Clifford B. LePage, who was on loan from a founding member, ASME.  An annual budget of $7,500 was provided by the founding bodies.\n\nIn 1931, the organization (renamed ASA in 1928) became affiliated with the U.S. National Committee of the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]), which had been formed in 1904 to develop electrical and electronics standards.<ref>[http://www.iec.ch/ Welcome to IEC - International Electrotechnical Commission<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n==Members==\nANSI's members are government agencies, organizations, corporations, academic and international bodies, and individuals. In total, the Institute represents the interests of more than 125,000 companies and 3.5 million professionals.<ref name=\"membership\">ANSI membership page, [http://www.ansi.org/membership/overview/overview.aspx?menuid=2www.ansi.org/membership www.ansi.org/membership]</ref>\n\n==Process==\nThough ANSI itself does not develop standards, the Institute oversees the development and use of standards by accrediting the procedures of standards developing organizations. ANSI accreditation signifies that the procedures used by standards developing organizations meet the Institute's requirements for openness, balance, consensus, and due process.\n\nANSI also designates specific standards as American National Standards, or ANS, when the Institute determines that the standards were developed in an environment that is equitable, accessible and responsive to the requirements of various stakeholders.<ref>[http://publicaa.ansi.org/sites/apdl/Documents/News%20and%20Publications/Brochures/Value%20of%20the%20ANS.pdf ''Value of the ANS Designation'' brochure]</ref>\n\nVoluntary consensus standards quicken the market acceptance of products while making clear how to improve the safety of those products for the protection of consumers. There are approximately 9,500 American National Standards that carry the ANSI designation.\n\nThe American National Standards process involves:\n*consensus by a group that is open to representatives from all interested parties\n*broad-based public review and comment on draft standards\n*consideration of and response to comments\n*incorporation of submitted changes that meet the same consensus requirements into a draft standard\n*availability of an appeal by any participant alleging that these principles were not respected during the standards-development process.\n\n==International activities==\nIn addition to facilitating the formation of standards in the United States, ANSI promotes the use of U.S. standards internationally, advocates U.S. policy and technical positions in international and regional standards organizations, and encourages the adoption of international standards as national standards where appropriate.\n\nThe Institute is the official U.S. representative to the two major international standards organizations, the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), as a founding member,<ref>[http://www.ansi.org/about_ansi/introduction/introduction.aspx ISO founding member]- Retrieved 2011-09-27</ref> and the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC), via the U.S. National Committee (USNC). ANSI participates in almost the entire technical program of both the ISO and the IEC, and administers many key committees and subgroups. In many instances, U.S. standards are taken forward to ISO and IEC, through ANSI or the USNC, where they are adopted in whole or in part as international standards.\n\n===Standards panels===\n<ref>[http://www.ansi.org/standards_activities/standards_boards_panels/overview.aspx?menuid=3 Overview]. Ansi.org. Retrieved on 2013-08-12.</ref>\nThe Institute administers nine standards panels:\n*ANSI Homeland Defense and Security Standardization Collaborative (HDSSC)\n*ANSI Nanotechnology Standards Panel (ANSI-NSP)\n*ID Theft Prevention and ID Management Standards Panel (IDSP)\n*ANSI Energy Efficiency Standardization Coordination Collaborative (EESCC)\n*Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC)\n*Electric Vehicles Standards Panel (EVSP)\n*ANSI-NAM Network on Chemical Regulation\n*ANSI Biofuels Standards Coordination Panel\n*Healthcare Information Technology Standards Panel (HITSP)\n\nEach of the panels works to identify, coordinate, and harmonize voluntary standards relevant to these areas.\n\nIn 2009, ANSI and the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST) formed the Nuclear Energy Standards Coordination Collaborative (NESCC). NESCC is a joint initiative to identify and respond to the current need for standards in the nuclear industry.\n\n===American national standards===\n*The [[ASA film speed|ASA]] (as for American Standards Association) photographic exposure system, originally defined in ASA Z38.2.1 (since 1943) and ASA PH2.5 (since 1954), together with the [[DIN film speed|DIN system (DIN 4512 since 1934)]], became the basis for the [[ISO film speed|ISO]] system (since 1974), currently used worldwide ([[ISO 6]], [[ISO 2240]], [[ISO 5800]], [[ISO 12232]]).\n*A standard for the set of values used to represent characters in digital computers.  The ANSI code standard extended the previously created [[ASCII]] seven bit code standard (ASA X3.4-1963), with additional codes for European alphabets (see also [[Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code]] or EBCDIC).  In [[Microsoft Windows]], the phrase \"ANSI\" refers to the [[Windows code page|Windows ANSI code page]]s (even though they are not ANSI standards).<ref name=\"ms glossary\">[http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/glossary.mspx Microsoft Glossary]</ref> Most of these are fixed width, though some characters for [[ideographic language]]s are variable width. Since these characters are based on a draft of the [[ISO-8859]] series, some of Microsoft's symbols are visually very similar to the ISO symbols, leading many to falsely assume that they are identical.\n*The first computer [[programming language]] standard was \"American Standard [[Fortran]]\" (informally known as \"FORTRAN 66\"), approved in March 1966 and published as ASA X3.9-1966.\n*The programming language [[COBOL]] had ANSI standards in 1968, 1974, and 1985. The COBOL 2002 standard was issued by [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]].\n*The original standard implementation of the programming language [[C (computer language)|C]] was standardized as ANSI X3.159-1989, becoming the well-known [[ANSI C]].\n*A popular [[Unified Thread Standard]] for nuts and bolts is ANSI/ASME B1.1 which was defined in 1935, 1949, 1989, and 2003.\n*The ANSI-NSF International standards used for commercial kitchens, such as restaurants, cafeterias, delis, etc.\n*The ANSI/APSP (Association of Pool & Spa Professionals) standards used for pools, spas, hot tubs, barriers, and suction entrapment avoidance.\n*The ANSI/HI ([[Hydraulic Institute]]) standards used for pumps.\n*The ANSI for [[eye protection]] is Z87.1, which gives a specific impact resistance rating to the eyewear. This standard is commonly used for shop glasses, shooting glasses, and many other examples of protective eyewear.\n*The [[Paper size#ANSI paper sizes|ANSI paper sizes]] (ANSI/ASME Y14.1).\n\n===Other initiatives===\n*In 2008 ANSI, in  partnership<ref>[http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202011754/http://www.citationtechnologies.com/alliances/ansi |date=December 2, 2008 }}</ref> with [[Citation Technologies]], created the first dynamic, online web library for [[ISO 14000]] standards.<ref name=iPackages>[http://ansi.org/news_publications/news_story.aspx?menuid=7&articleid=1892 ANSI ISO 14000 Press Release]</ref>\n*On June 23, 2009, ANSI announced a product and services agreement with [[Citation Technologies]] to deliver all ISO Standards on a web-based platform.

Mission commander [[Neil Armstrong]] and pilot [[Buzz Aldrin]], both American, landed the [[Apollo Lunar Module|lunar module]] ''Eagle'' on July 20, 1969, at 20:18 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]. Armstrong became the first to step onto the lunar surface six hours after landing on July 21 at 02:56:15 UTC; Aldrin joined him about 20 minutes later. They spent about two and a quarter hours together outside the spacecraft, and collected {{convert|47.5|lb|kg}} of lunar material to bring back to Earth. [[Michael Collins (astronaut)|Michael Collins]] piloted the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|command module]] ''Columbia'' alone in lunar orbit while they were on the Moon's surface. Armstrong and Aldrin spent just under a day on the lunar surface before rejoining ''Columbia'' in lunar orbit.\n\nApollo 11 was launched by a [[Saturn V]] rocket from [[Kennedy Space Center]] in [[Merritt Island, Florida]], on July 16, and was the fifth manned mission of [[NASA]]'s [[Apollo program]]. The Apollo [[Apollo (spacecraft)|spacecraft]] had three parts: a command module (CM) with a cabin for the three astronauts, and the only part that landed back on Earth; a service module (SM), which supported the command module with propulsion, electrical power, oxygen, and water; and a lunar module (LM) that had two stages \u2013 a lower stage for landing on the Moon, and an upper stage to place the astronauts back into lunar orbit. \n\nAfter being sent toward the Moon by the Saturn V's upper stage, the astronauts separated the spacecraft from it and traveled for three days until they entered into lunar orbit. Armstrong and Aldrin then moved into the lunar module ''Eagle'' and landed in the [[Mare Tranquillitatis|Sea of Tranquility]]. They stayed a total of about 21.5 hours on the lunar surface. The astronauts used ''Eagle'''s upper stage to lift off from the lunar surface and rejoin Collins in the command module. They jettisoned ''Eagle'' before they performed the maneuvers that blasted them out of lunar orbit on a trajectory back to Earth. They returned to Earth and landed in the Pacific Ocean on July 24.\n\nThe landing was broadcast on live TV to a worldwide audience. Armstrong stepped onto the lunar surface and described the event as \"one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind.\" Apollo 11 effectively ended the [[Space Race]] and fulfilled a national goal proposed in 1961 by [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[John F. Kennedy]]: \"before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the Earth.\"<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |title=Man on the Moon: Kennedy speech ignited the dream |work=CNN |last=Stenger |first=Richard |date=May 25, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100606035837/http://archives.cnn.com/2001/TECH/space/05/25/kennedy.moon/ |archivedate=June 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Framework==\n\n===Crew===\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology   = Astronaut\n|position1    = Commander\n|crew1_up     = [[Neil Armstrong|Neil A.

The computer (or rather the software in it) was smart enough to recognize that it was being asked to perform more tasks than it should be performing.

The sequence that occurred in the Apollo 11 landing was successful because of its global error detection and recovery system. This included the restart capability to \"kill and start over again\" and recompute and the display interface routines (\"priority displays\") providing the ability, in the case of an emergency, to interrupt nominal displays with higher priority alarm displays. Steps previously taken to create solutions that took advantage of this multiprogramming environment suggested solutions for multiprocessing. Although only one process is actively executing at a given time in a multiprogramming environment, other processes in the same system\u2015sleeping or waiting\u2015exist in parallel with the executing process. With this as a backdrop, the priority display mechanisms were created, essentially changing the man-machine interface between the astronauts and the onboard flight software from synchronous to asynchronous displays so that a mission could be reconfigured in real time should it become necessary to do so.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=Margaret H. |last2=Hackler |first2=William R. |date=December 2008 |title=Universal Systems Language: Lessons Learned from Apollo |volume=41 |issue=12 |pages=34\u201343 |journal=Computer |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[IEEE Computer Society]] |issn=0018-9162 |doi=10.1109/MC.2008.541 |url=http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MC.2008.541 |accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>}}|Letter from [[Margaret Hamilton (scientist)|Margaret H.

Also, according to Deke Slayton's book ''Moonshot'', Armstrong carried with him a special diamond-studded astronaut pin from Slayton.\n\n[[File:Apollo 11 lunar module.jpg|thumb|''Eagle''{{'s}} ascent stage approaching ''Columbia'']]\n\nFilm taken from the LM Ascent Stage upon liftoff from the Moon reveals the American flag, planted some {{Convert|25|ft|m|0}} from the descent stage, whipping violently in the exhaust of the ascent stage engine.

Just before the [[Apollo 12]] flight, it was noted that ''Eagle'' was still likely to be orbiting the Moon. Later NASA reports mentioned that ''Eagle''{{'s}} orbit had decayed, resulting in it impacting in an \"uncertain location\" on the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/apollo_tables.html |title=Apollo Tables |last=Williams |first=David R. |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=September 23, 2006}}</ref> The location is uncertain because the ''Eagle'' ascent stage was not tracked after it was jettisoned, and the lunar gravity field is sufficiently non-uniform to make the orbit of the spacecraft unpredictable after a short time. NASA estimated that the orbit had decayed within months and would have impacted on the Moon.\n\nOn July 23, the last night before splashdown, the three astronauts made a television broadcast in which Collins commented: <blockquote>...&nbsp;The Saturn V rocket which put us in orbit is an incredibly complicated piece of machinery, every piece of which worked flawlessly&nbsp;... We have always had confidence that this equipment will work properly. All this is possible only through the blood, sweat, and tears of a number of a people&nbsp;... All you see is the three of us, but beneath the surface are thousands and thousands of others, and to all of those, I would like to say, \"Thank you very much.\"</blockquote>\n\nAldrin added: <blockquote>This has been far more than three men on a mission to the Moon; more, still, than the efforts of a government and industry team; more, even, than the efforts of one nation. We feel that this stands as a symbol of the insatiable curiosity of all mankind to explore the unknown&nbsp;... Personally, in reflecting on the events of the past several days, a verse from Psalms comes to mind. \"When I consider the heavens, the work of Thy fingers, the Moon and the stars, which Thou hast ordained; What is man that Thou art mindful of him?\"</blockquote>\n\nArmstrong concluded: <blockquote>The responsibility for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit|EMU]], the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We would like to give special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other people that are listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.<ref name=\"Apollo-11 (27)\" /></blockquote>\n\nOn the return to Earth, a bearing at the Guam tracking station failed, potentially preventing communication on the last segment of the Earth return. A regular repair was not possible in the available time but the station director, Charles Force, had his ten-year-old son Greg use his small hands to reach into the housing and pack it with grease.

The three-[[astronaut]] crew \u2014 Commander [[Frank Borman]], Command Module Pilot [[Jim Lovell|James Lovell]], and Lunar Module Pilot [[William Anders]] \u2014 became the first humans to: travel beyond [[low Earth orbit]]; escape Earth's gravity; see Earth as a whole planet; enter the gravity well of another celestial body (Earth's moon); orbit another celestial body (Earth's moon); directly see the [[far side of the Moon]] with their own eyes; witness an [[Earthrise]]; escape the gravity of another celestial body (Earth's moon); and re-enter the gravitational well of Earth. The 1968 mission, the third flight of the [[Saturn V|Saturn&nbsp;V]] rocket and that rocket's first crewed launch, was also the first human spaceflight launch from the [[Kennedy Space Center]], Florida, located adjacent to [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]].\n\nOriginally planned as a second [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]]/[[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command Module]] test in an elliptical [[medium Earth orbit]] in early 1969, the mission profile was changed in August 1968 to a more ambitious Command Module-only lunar orbital flight to be flown in December, because the Lunar Module was not yet ready to make its first flight. This meant Borman's crew was scheduled to fly two to three months sooner than originally planned, leaving them a shorter time for training and preparation, thus placing more demands than usual on their time and discipline.\n\nApollo 8 took three days to travel to the Moon. It orbited ten times over the course of 20 hours, during which the crew made a Christmas Eve [[Apollo TV camera|television broadcast]] where they [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read the first 10 verses from]] the [[Book of Genesis]].  At the time, the broadcast was the most watched TV program ever. Apollo 8's successful mission paved the way for [[Apollo 11]] to fulfill U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s goal of landing a man on the Moon before the end of the 1960s. The Apollo 8 astronauts returned to Earth on December 27, 1968, when their spacecraft splashed down in the Northern Pacific Ocean. The crew was named [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]'s \"Men of the Year\" for 1968 upon their return.\n\n==Crew==\n\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut\n|position1        = Commander\n|crew1_up         = [[Frank Borman|Frank F.

However, Collins was replaced in July 1968, after suffering a [[intervertebral disc|cervical]] [[Spinal disc herniation|disc herniation]] that required surgery to repair.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], pp. 288\u2013294</ref>\n\nThis crew was unique among pre-shuttle era missions in that the commander was not the most experienced member of the crew, as Lovell had flown twice before, on [[Gemini 7|Gemini VII]] and [[Gemini 12|Gemini XII]]. This was also the first case of the rarity of an astronaut who had commanded a spaceflight mission subsequently flying as a non-commander, as Lovell had previously commanded Gemini XII.\n\n===Backup crew===\n{{Spaceflight crew\n|terminology      = Astronaut\n|position1        = Commander\n|crew1_up         = [[Neil Armstrong|Neil A.

When Lovell was rotated to the prime crew, no one with experience on [[Apollo Command/Service Module|CSM]]-103 (the specific spacecraft used for the mission) was available, so Aldrin was moved to CMP and [[Fred Haise]] brought in as backup LMP. Neil Armstrong went on to command Apollo 11, where Aldrin was returned to the LMP position and Collins was assigned as CMP. Haise was rotated out of the crew and onto the backup crew of Apollo 11 as LMP.\n\n===Mission control===\nThe Earth-based mission control teams for Apollo&nbsp;8 consisted of astronauts assigned to the support crew, as well as non-astronaut flight directors and their staffs. The support crew members were not trained to fly the mission, but were able to stand in for astronauts in meetings and be involved in the minutiae of mission planning, while the prime and backup crews trained. They also served as [[Flight controller#Capsule Communicator (CAPCOM)|CAPCOMs]] during the mission. For Apollo&nbsp;8, these crew members included astronauts [[John S. Bull]], [[Vance D. Brand]], [[Gerald P. Carr]], and [[Ken Mattingly]].<ref name=\"chronapp6\">{{cite book |last1=Ertel |first1=Ivan D. |last2=Newkirk |first2=Roland W. |last3=Brooks |first3=Courtney G. |others=Compiled by Sally D.

Since the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] (CSM) would be ready three months before the Lunar Module, a CSM-only mission could be flown in December 1968. Instead of just repeating the \"C\" mission flight of Apollo&nbsp;7, this CSM could be sent all the way to the Moon, with the possibility of entering a lunar orbit. The new mission would also allow NASA to test lunar landing procedures that would otherwise have to wait until [[Apollo 10]], the scheduled \"F\" mission.<ref name=\"augsep1968\" /> This also meant that the medium Earth orbit \"E\" mission could be dispensed with. The net result was that only the \"D\" mission had to be delayed.\n\n[[File:Apollo 8 first stage in the Vehicle Assembly Building.jpg|thumb|upright|The first stage of AS-503 being erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] (VAB) on February 1, 1968]]\nAlmost every senior manager at NASA agreed with this new mission, citing both confidence in the hardware and personnel, and the potential for a significant morale boost provided by a circumlunar flight. The only person who needed some convincing was [[James E. Webb]], the NASA administrator. With the rest of his agency in support of the new mission, Webb eventually approved the mission change. The mission was officially changed from a \"D\" mission to a \"C-Prime\" lunar-orbit mission, but was still referred to in press releases as an Earth-orbit mission at Webb's direction.<ref name=\"chariots11-5\">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

When it was erected in the [[Vehicle Assembly Building|Vertical Assembly Building]] on December 20, 1967, it was thought that the rocket would be used for an unmanned Earth-orbit test flight carrying a [[Boilerplate (spaceflight)|boilerplate]] Command/Service Module. Apollo&nbsp;6 had suffered several major problems during its April 1968 flight, including severe [[pogo oscillation]] during its first stage, two second stage engine failures, and a third stage that failed to reignite in orbit. Without assurances that these problems had been rectified, NASA administrators could not justify risking a manned mission until additional unmanned test flights proved that the Saturn&nbsp;V was ready.<ref name=\"stages1\">[[#Bilstein|Bilstein 1996]], pp. 360\u2013370</ref><ref name=\"chariots10-5\">{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Courtney G. |last2=Grimwood |first2=James M. |last3=Swenson |first3=Loyd S., Jr. |others=Foreword by Samuel C.

Of primary concern was the pogo oscillation, which would not only hamper engine performance, but could exert significant g-forces on a crew. A task force of contractors, NASA agency representatives, and MSFC researchers concluded that the engines vibrated at a frequency similar to the frequency at which the spacecraft itself vibrated, causing a resonance effect that induced oscillations in the rocket. A system using helium gas to absorb some of these vibrations was installed.<ref name=\"stages1\" />\n\nOf equal importance was the failure of three engines during flight. Researchers quickly determined that a leaking hydrogen fuel line ruptured when exposed to vacuum, causing a loss of fuel pressure in engine two. When an automatic shutoff attempted to close the liquid hydrogen valve and shut down engine two, it accidentally shut down engine three's liquid oxygen due to a miswired connection. As a result, engine three failed within one second of engine two's shutdown. Further investigation revealed the same problem for the third-stage engine\u2014a faulty igniter line. The team modified the igniter lines and fuel conduits, hoping to avoid similar problems on future launches.<ref name=\"stages1\" />\n\nThe teams tested their solutions in August 1968 at the Marshall Space Flight Center. A Saturn stage IC was equipped with shock absorbing devices to demonstrate the team's solution to the problem of pogo oscillation, while a Saturn Stage&nbsp;II was retrofitted with modified fuel lines to demonstrate their resistance to leaks and ruptures in vacuum conditions.

Although Mission Control performed all the actual navigation calculations, it was necessary to have a crew member serving as navigator so that the crew could return to Earth in case of loss of communication with Mission Control. Lovell navigated by star sightings using a [[sextant]] built into the spacecraft, measuring the angle between a star and the Earth's (or the Moon's) [[horizon]]. This task was difficult, because a large cloud of debris around the spacecraft, formed by the venting S-IVB, made it hard to distinguish the stars.\n\nBy seven hours into the mission, the crew was about one hour and 40 minutes behind flight plan, because of the problems in moving away from the S-IVB and Lovell's obscured star sightings. The crew now placed the spacecraft into Passive Thermal Control (PTC), also called \"barbecue roll\", in which the spacecraft rotated about once per hour around its long axis to ensure even heat distribution across the surface of the spacecraft. In direct sunlight, the spacecraft could be heated to over {{convert|200|C|F}} while the parts in shadow would be {{convert|-100|C|F}}. These temperatures could cause the [[atmospheric reentry#Thermal protection systems|heat shield]] to crack and propellant lines to burst. Because it was impossible to get a perfect roll, the spacecraft swept out a [[Conical surface|cone]] as it rotated. The crew had to make minor adjustments every half hour as the cone pattern got larger and larger.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/04day1_maroon.htm |title=Day 1: Maroon Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

Testing on the ground had shown that the [[Apollo Command/Service Module#Service Propulsion System|Service Propulsion System]] (SPS) engine had a small chance of exploding when burned for long periods unless its [[combustion chamber]] was \"coated\" first. Burning the engine for a short period would accomplish coating. This first correction burn was only 2.4 seconds and added about {{convert|20.4|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} velocity [[Retrograde and prograde motion|prograde]] (in the direction of travel).<ref name=\"orloff1\" /> This change was less than the planned {{convert|24.8|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, because of a bubble of [[helium]] in the [[nitrogen tetroxide|oxidizer]] lines, which caused unexpectedly low propellant pressure. The crew had to use the small RCS thrusters to make up the shortfall. Two later planned mid-course corrections were canceled because the Apollo&nbsp;8 trajectory was found to be perfect.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\"/>\n\nEleven hours into the flight, the crew had been awake for more than 16 hours. Before launch, NASA had decided that at least one crew member should be awake at all times to deal with problems that might arise. Borman started the first sleep shift, but found sleeping difficult because of the constant radio chatter and mechanical noises.<ref name=\"journal day 1 Maroon\"/>\n\nAbout an hour after starting his sleep shift, Borman obtained permission from [[flight controller|ground control]] to take a [[Secobarbital|Seconal]] [[Barbiturate|sleeping pill]]. The pill had little effect. Borman eventually fell asleep, and then awoke feeling ill. He vomited twice and had a bout of diarrhea; this left the spacecraft full of small globules of vomit and feces, which the crew cleaned up as well as they could. Borman initially did not want everyone to know about his medical problems, but Lovell and Anders wanted to inform Mission Control. The crew decided to use the Data Storage Equipment (DSE), which could tape voice recordings and telemetry and dump them to Mission Control at high speed. After recording a description of Borman's illness they asked Mission Control to check the recording, stating that they \"would like an evaluation of the voice comments\".<ref name=\"journal day 2 green\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/06day2_green.htm |title=Day 2: Green Team |last1=Woods |first1=W.

The conference participants concluded that there was little to worry about and that Borman's illness was either a [[Gastroenteritis|24-hour flu]], as Borman thought, or a reaction to the sleeping pill.<ref>[[#Collins|Collins 2001]], p. 306</ref> Researchers now believe that he was suffering from [[Space adaptation syndrome|space-adaptation syndrome]], which affects about a third of astronauts during their first day in space as their [[Labyrinth (inner ear)|vestibular system]] adapts to [[weightlessness]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Quine |first=Tony |date=April 2007|title=Addicted to space: An appreciation of Anousheh Ansari, Part II |journal= Spaceflight|volume=49 |issue=4 |page=144|issn=0038-6340 |publisher=[[British Interplanetary Society]]}}</ref> Space-adaptation syndrome had not occurred on previous spacecraft ([[Project Mercury|Mercury]] and [[Project Gemini|Gemini]]), because those astronauts couldn't move freely in the small cabins of those spacecraft.

During this time, NASA scheduled a television broadcast at 31&nbsp;hours after launch. The Apollo&nbsp;8 crew used a 2&nbsp;kg camera that broadcast in [[black-and-white]] only, using a [[Video camera tube|Vidicon]] tube. The camera had two [[lens (optics)|lenses]], a very [[wide-angle lens|wide-angle (160\u00b0) lens]], and a [[telephoto lens|telephoto (9\u00b0) lens]].<ref name=\"chariots11-6\" />\n\nDuring this first broadcast, the crew gave a tour of the spacecraft and attempted to show how the Earth appeared from space. However, difficulties aiming the narrow-angle lens without the aid of a monitor to show what it was looking at made showing the Earth impossible. Additionally, the Earth image became saturated by any bright source without proper [[Optical filter|filters]]. In the end, all the crew could show the people watching back on Earth was a bright blob. After broadcasting for 17&nbsp;minutes, the rotation of the spacecraft took the [[high-gain antenna]] out of view of the receiving stations on Earth and they ended the transmission with Lovell wishing his mother a happy birthday.<ref name=\"chariots11-6\" />\n\nBy this time, the crew had completely abandoned the planned sleep shifts. Lovell went to sleep 32\u00bd&nbsp;hours into the flight\u20143\u00bd&nbsp;hours before he had planned to. A short while later, Anders also went to sleep after taking a sleeping pill.<ref name=\"chariots11-6\" />\n\nThe crew was unable to see the Moon for much of the outward cruise. Two factors made the Moon almost impossible to see from inside the spacecraft: three of the five windows fogging up due to out-gassed oils from the [[silicone]] [[sealant]], and the [[Orientation (geometry)|attitude]] required for the PTC. It was not until the crew had gone behind the Moon that they would be able to see it for the first time.<ref name=\"zimmerman1\" />\n\nApollo&nbsp;8 made a second television broadcast at 55&nbsp;hours into the flight. This time, the crew rigged up filters meant for the still cameras so they could acquire images of the Earth through the telephoto lens. Although difficult to aim, as they had to maneuver the entire spacecraft, the crew was able to broadcast back to Earth the first television pictures of the Earth. The crew spent the transmission describing the Earth and what was visible and the colors they could see. The transmission lasted 23&nbsp;minutes.<ref name=\"chariots11-6\" />\n\n===Lunar sphere of influence===\nAt about 55&nbsp;hours and 40&nbsp;minutes into the flight, the crew of Apollo&nbsp;8 became the first humans to enter the gravitational sphere of influence of another celestial body.<ref name=\"orloff1\" /> In other words, the effect of the Moon's [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|gravitational force]] on Apollo&nbsp;8 became stronger than that of the Earth. At the time it happened, Apollo&nbsp;8 was {{convert|38759|mi|km}} from the Moon and had a speed of {{convert|3990|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}} relative to the Moon.<ref name=\"orloff1\" /> This historic moment was of little interest to the crew since they were still calculating their [[trajectory]] with respect to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center. They would continue to do so until they performed their last mid-course correction, switching to a [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] based on ideal orientation for the second engine burn they would make in lunar orbit. It was only 13&nbsp;hours until they would be in lunar orbit.<ref name=\"lostmoon\">[[#Lovell & Kluger|Lovell & Kluger 1994]]</ref>\n\nThe last major event before Lunar Orbit Insertion (LOI) was a second mid-course correction. It was in [[Retrograde and direct motion|retrograde]] (against direction of travel) and slowed the spacecraft down by {{convert|2.0|ft/s|m/s|abbr=on}}, effectively lowering the closest distance that the spacecraft would pass the moon.<ref name=\"orloff1\" /> At exactly 61&nbsp;hours after launch, about {{convert|24200|mi|km}} from the Moon, the crew burned the RCS for 11&nbsp;seconds. They would now pass {{convert|71.7|mi|km}} from the [[Geology of the Moon#Lunar landscape|lunar surface]].<ref name=\"zimmerman1\" /><ref name=\"orloff1\" />\n\nAt 64&nbsp;hours into the flight, the crew began to prepare for Lunar Orbit Insertion-1 (LOI-1). This maneuver had to be performed perfectly, and due to [[orbital mechanics]] had to be on the far side of the Moon, out of contact with the Earth. After Mission Control was polled for a \"[[Launch status check|go/no go]]\" decision, the crew was told at 68&nbsp;hours, they were Go and \"riding the best bird we can find\".<ref name=\"journal day 3 LOI\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/11day3_black_approach.htm |title=Day 3: The Black Team - Approaching the Moon |last1=Woods |first1=W.

At that time, they finally got their first glimpses of the Moon. They had been flying over the unlit side, and it was Lovell who saw the first shafts of sunlight [[wiktionary:oblique|oblique]]ly illuminating the lunar surface. The LOI burn was only two&nbsp;minutes away, so the crew had little time to appreciate the view.<ref name=\"lostmoon\" />\n\n===Lunar orbit===\nThe SPS ignited at 69&nbsp;hours, 8&nbsp;minutes, and 16&nbsp;seconds after launch and burned for 4&nbsp;minutes and 7&nbsp;seconds, placing the Apollo&nbsp;8 spacecraft in orbit around the Moon. The crew described the burn as being the longest four minutes of their lives. If the burn had not lasted exactly the correct amount of time, the spacecraft could have ended up in a highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] lunar orbit or even flung off into space. If it lasted too long they could have struck the Moon. After making sure the spacecraft was working, they finally had a chance to look at the Moon, which they would orbit for the next 20&nbsp;hours.<ref name=\"nssdc orbit\">{{cite web |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/masterCatalog.do?sc=1968-118A |title=Apollo 8 |work=[[National Space Science Data Center]] |publisher=NASA |accessdate=June 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn Earth, Mission Control continued to wait. If the crew had not burned the engine or the burn had not lasted the planned length of time, the crew would appear early from behind the Moon. However, this time came and went without Apollo&nbsp;8 reappearing. Exactly at the calculated moment, the signal was received from the spacecraft, indicating it was in a {{convert|193.3|by|69.5|mi|km|adj=on}} orbit about the Moon.<ref name=\"nssdc orbit\" />\n\nAfter reporting on the status of the spacecraft, Lovell gave the first description of what the lunar surface looked like:\n{{quote|The Moon is essentially grey, no color; looks like [[plaster of Paris]] or sort of a grayish beach sand. We can see quite a bit of detail. The [[Mare Fecunditatis|Sea of Fertility]] doesn't stand out as well here as it does back on Earth. There's not as much contrast between that and the surrounding craters. The craters are all rounded off. There's quite a few of them, some of them are newer. Many of them look like\u2014especially the round ones\u2014look like hit by [[meteorite]]s or projectiles of some sort.

One of the crew's major tasks was [[reconnaissance]] of planned future landing sites on the Moon, especially one in [[Mare Tranquillitatis]] that would be the Apollo&nbsp;11 landing site. The launch time of Apollo&nbsp;8 had been chosen to give the best lighting conditions for examining the site. A [[film camera]] had been set up in one of the spacecraft windows to record a frame every second of the Moon below. Bill Anders spent much of the next 20&nbsp;hours taking as many photographs as possible of targets of interest. By the end of the mission the crew had taken 700 photographs of the Moon and 150 of the Earth.<ref name=\"zimmerman1\" />\n\nThroughout the hour that the spacecraft was in contact with Earth, Borman kept asking how the data for the SPS looked. He wanted to make sure that the engine was working and could be used to return early to the Earth if necessary. He also asked that they receive a \"go/no go\" decision before they passed behind the Moon on each orbit.<ref name=\"journal day 4-123\" />\n\nAs they reappeared for their second pass in front of the Moon, the crew set up the equipment to broadcast a view of the lunar surface. Anders described the craters that they were passing over. At the end of this second orbit they performed the 11-second LOI-2 burn of the SPS to circularize the orbit to {{convert|70.0|by|71.3|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"nssdc orbit\" /><ref name=\"journal day 4-123\" />\n\nThrough the next two orbits, the crew continued to keep check of the spacecraft and to observe and photograph the Moon. During the third pass, Borman read a small prayer for his church. He had been scheduled to participate in a service at St. Christopher's [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal Church]] near [[Seabrook, Texas]], but due to the Apollo&nbsp;8 flight he was unable to. A fellow parishioner and engineer at Mission Control, Rod Rose, suggested that Borman read the prayer which could be recorded and then replayed during the service.<ref name=\"zimmerman1\" /><ref name=\"journal day 4-123\" />\n\n====Earthrise====\n{{main article|Earthrise}}\nWhen the spacecraft came out from behind the Moon for its fourth pass across the front, the crew witnessed \"Earthrise\" for the first time in human history (NASA's [[Lunar Orbiter 1]] took the very first picture of an Earthrise from the vicinity of the Moon, on August 23, 1966).<ref>[[#Poole|Poole 2008]]</ref> Borman saw the Earth emerging from behind the lunar horizon, and then called in excitement to the others, taking a black-and-white photograph as he did so. In the ensuing scramble Anders took ''[[Earthrise]]'', a more famous color photo, later picked by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine as one of its hundred photos of the century.<ref name=\"journal day 4-456\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/14day4_orbits456.htm |title=Day 4: Lunar Orbits 4, 5 and 6 |last1=Woods |first1=W.

Earthrise is generally only visible when orbiting the Moon, other than at selected places near the Moon's [[lunar limb|limb]], where [[libration]] carries the Earth slightly above and below the lunar horizon.\n\nAnders continued to take photographs while Lovell assumed control of the spacecraft so Borman could rest.<ref name=\"journal day 4-456\"/> Despite the difficulty resting in the cramped and noisy spacecraft, Borman was able to sleep for two orbits, awakening periodically to ask questions about their status.<ref name=\"journal day 4-456\"/> Borman awoke fully, however, when he started to hear his fellow crew members make mistakes. They were beginning to not understand questions and would have to ask for the answers to be repeated. Borman realized that everyone was extremely tired from not having a good night's sleep in over three days. He ordered Anders and Lovell to get some sleep and that the rest of the flight plan regarding observing the Moon be scrubbed. At first Anders protested saying that he was fine, but Borman would not be swayed. At last Anders agreed as long as Borman would set up the camera to continue to take automatic shots of the Moon. Borman also remembered that there was a second television broadcast planned, and with so many people expected to be watching he wanted the crew to be alert. For the next two orbits Anders and Lovell slept while Borman sat at the helm. On subsequent Apollo missions, crews would avoid this situation by sleeping on the same schedule.\n[[File:Apollo 8 genesis reading.ogg|left|thumb|The Apollo 8 Genesis reading.]]\n\nAs they rounded the Moon for the ninth time, the second television transmission began. Borman introduced the crew, followed by each man giving his impression of the lunar surface and what it was like to be orbiting the Moon. Borman described it as being \"a vast, lonely, forbidding expanse of nothing\".<ref>[[#De Groot|De Groot 2006]], p. 229</ref> Then, after talking about what they were flying over, Anders said that the crew had a message for all those on Earth. Each man on board [[Apollo 8 Genesis reading|read a section from the Biblical creation story]] from the Book of Genesis. Borman finished the broadcast by wishing a Merry Christmas to everyone on Earth. His message appeared to sum up the feelings that all three crewmen had from their vantage point in lunar orbit. Borman said, \"And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas and God bless all of you\u2014all of you on the good Earth.\"<ref name=\"moonport\">{{cite book |last1=Benson |first1=Charles D. |last2=Faherty |first2=William Barnaby |title=Moonport: A History of Apollo Launch Facilities and Operations |url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123133438/http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/contents.html |archivedate=January 23, 2008 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |year=1978 |publisher=NASA |id=NASA SP-4204 |chapter=Apollo 8 - A Christmas Gift |chapterurl=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/History/SP-4204/ch20-9.html |deadurl=no}} Ch.20-9.</ref>\n\nThe only task left for the crew at this point was to perform the [[Trans-Earth injection|Trans-Earth Injection]] (TEI), which was scheduled for 2\u00bd&nbsp;hours after the end of the television transmission. The TEI was the most critical burn of the flight, as any failure of the SPS to ignite would strand the crew in lunar orbit, with little hope of escape. As with the previous burn, the crew had to perform the maneuver above the far side of the Moon, out of contact with Earth.\n\nThe burn occurred exactly on time. The spacecraft telemetry was reacquired as it re-emerged from behind the Moon at 89&nbsp;hours, 28&nbsp;minutes, and 39&nbsp;seconds, the exact time calculated. When voice contact was regained, Lovell announced, \"Please be informed, there is a [[Santa Claus]]\", to which Ken Mattingly, the current CAPCOM, replied, \"That's affirmative, you are the best ones to know.\"<ref name=\"journal day 4 TEI\">{{cite web |url=https://history.nasa.gov/ap08fj/16day4_final_orbit_tei.htm |title=Day 4: Final Orbit and Trans-Earth Injection |last1=Woods |first1=W.

However, he accidentally erased some of the computer's memory, which caused the [[Apollo PGNCS#Inertial Measurement Unit|Inertial Measurement Unit]] (IMU) to think the module was in the same relative position it had been in before lift-off and fire the thrusters to \"correct\" the module's attitude.<ref name=\"Benke\" />\n\nOnce the crew realized why the computer had changed the module's attitude, they realized they would have to re-enter data that would tell the computer its real position. It took Lovell ten&nbsp;minutes to figure out the right numbers, using the thrusters to get the stars [[Rigel]] and [[Sirius]] aligned, and another 15&nbsp;minutes to enter the corrected data into the computer.<ref name=\"lostmoon\" />\n\nSixteen months later, Lovell would once again have to perform a similar manual re-alignment, under more critical conditions, during the [[Apollo 13]] mission, after that module's IMU had to be turned off to conserve energy. In his 1994 book, ''[[Lost Moon|Lost Moon: The Perilous Voyage of Apollo 13]]'', Lovell wrote, \"My training &#91;on Apollo 8&#93; came in handy!\" In that book he dismissed the incident as a \"planned experiment\", requested by the ground crew.<ref name=\"lostmoon\" /> In subsequent interviews Lovell has acknowledged that the incident was an accident, caused by his mistake.<ref name=\"Benke\" /><ref name=\"zimmerman1\" />\n\n===Cruise back to Earth and re-entry===\n[[File:Apollo 8 reentry, December 27, 1968.jpg|thumb|Reentry, December 27, 1968, photographed from a [[KC-135]] at 40,000 feet]]\n\nThe cruise back to Earth was mostly a time for the crew to relax and monitor the spacecraft. As long as the trajectory specialists had calculated everything correctly, the spacecraft would re-enter two-and-half days after TEI and [[splashdown (spacecraft landing)|splashdown]] in the Pacific.\n\nOn Christmas afternoon, the crew made their fifth television broadcast.<ref>\n{{cite video\n| date      = 2003\n| title     = Apollo 8: Leaving the Cradle\n| url       = http://www.collectspace.com/resources/reviews/dvd/apollo8_leaving_the_cradle.html\n| time      = Chapter 5, Disk 2\n| medium    = DVD\n| publisher = Spacecraft Films/[[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment]]\n}}\n\n</ref> This time they gave a tour of the spacecraft, showing how an astronaut lived in space.

The first known use of the term \"astronaut\" in the modern sense was by [[Neil R. Jones]] in his short story \"The Death's Head Meteor\" in 1930. The word itself had been known earlier. For example, in [[Percy Greg]]'s 1880 book ''Across the Zodiac'', \"astronaut\" referred to a spacecraft. In ''Les Navigateurs de l'Infini'' (1925) of [[J.-H. Rosny a\u00een\u00e9]], the word ''astronautique'' (astronautic) was used. The word may have been inspired by \"aeronaut\", an older term for an air traveler first applied (in 1784) to [[balloon (aircraft)|balloon]]ists.

(The packaging for each meal weighs around 0.12 kilograms - 0.27 pounds)  Longer-duration missions require more food.\n\nShuttle astronauts worked with nutritionists to select menus that appeal to their individual tastes. Five months before flight, menus are selected and analyzed for nutritional content by the shuttle dietician. Foods are tested to see how they will react in a reduced gravity environment.  Caloric requirements are determined using a basal energy expenditure (BEE) formula.\nOn Earth, the average American uses about 35 gallons (132 liters) of water every day.  On board the ISS astronauts limit water use to only about three gallons (11 liters) per day.<ref>{{cite web|title=Human Needs: Sustaining Life During Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/everydaylife/jamestown-needs-fs.html|website=www.nasa.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Insignia==\nIn Russia, cosmonauts are awarded [[Pilot-Cosmonaut of the Russian Federation]] upon completion of their missions, often accompanied with the award of [[Hero of the Russian Federation]].

Once they have flown in space, they receive a gold pin. U.S. astronauts who also have active-duty military status receive a special qualification badge, known as the [[Astronaut Badge]], after participation on a spaceflight. The [[United States Air Force]] also presents an Astronaut Badge to its pilots who exceed {{convert|50|mi|km}} in altitude.\n\n[[File:amf space mirror.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Space Mirror Memorial]]\n\n==Deaths==\n{{Main article|List of spaceflight-related accidents and incidents#Astronaut fatalities}}\n\nEighteen astronauts (fourteen men and four women) have lost their lives during four space flights. By nationality, thirteen were American (including one born in India), four were Russian ([[Soviet Union]]), and one was Israeli.\n\nEleven people (all men) have lost their lives training for spaceflight: eight Americans and three Russians.

Thank you. -->''''',<ref name=\"gutenberg\">{{cite web | url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1080/1080-h/1080-h.htm | title=A Modest Proposal, by Dr. Jonathan Swift | publisher=[[Project Gutenberg]] | date=27 July 2008 | accessdate=10 January 2012}}</ref> commonly referred to as '''''A Modest Proposal''''', is a [[Satire#Juvenalian|Juvenalian satirical]] [[essay]] written and published anonymously by [[Jonathan Swift]] in 1729.  Swift suggests that the impoverished Irish might ease their economic troubles by selling their children as food for rich gentlemen and ladies. This satirical [[hyperbole]] mocked heartless attitudes towards the poor, as well as [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] policy toward the [[Irish people|Irish]] in general.\n\nIn English writing, the phrase \"a modest proposal\" is now conventionally an allusion to this style of straight-faced satire.\n\n==Details==\nSwift goes to great lengths to support his argument, including a list of possible preparation styles for the children, and calculations showing the financial benefits of his suggestion. He uses methods of argument throughout his essay which lampoon the then-influential [[William Petty]] and the [[Social engineering (political science)|social engineering]] popular among followers of [[Francis Bacon]]. These lampoons include [[appeal to authority|appealing to the authority]] of \"a very knowing American of my acquaintance in London\" and \"the famous [[George Psalmanazar|Psalmanazar]], a native of the island [[Taiwan|Formosa]]\" (who had already confessed to ''not'' being from Formosa in 1706). This essay is widely held to be one of the greatest examples of sustained irony in the history of the English language. Much of its shock value derives from the fact that the first portion of the essay describes the plight of starving beggars in Ireland, so that the reader is unprepared for the surprise of Swift's solution when he states, \"A young healthy child well nursed, is, at a year old, a most delicious nourishing and wholesome food, whether stewed, roasted, baked, or boiled; and I make no doubt that it will equally serve in a [[fricassee]], or a [[ragout]].\"<ref name=\"gutenberg\" />\n \nIn the tradition of Roman satire, Swift introduces the reforms he is actually suggesting by [[paralipsis]]:\n{{quote|Therefore let no man talk to me of other expedients: Of taxing our absentees at five shillings a pound: Of using neither clothes, nor household furniture, except what is of our own growth and manufacture: Of utterly rejecting the materials and instruments that promote foreign luxury: Of curing the expensiveness of pride, vanity, idleness, and gaming in our women: Of introducing a vein of parsimony, prudence and temperance: Of learning to love our country, wherein we differ even from [[Sami people|Laplanders]], and the [[Tupi people|inhabitants of Topinamboo]]: Of quitting our animosities and factions, nor acting any longer like the Jews, who were [[Zealot Temple Siege|murdering one another]] at the very moment [[Siege of Jerusalem (70)|their city was taken]]: Of being a little cautious not to sell our country and consciences for nothing: Of teaching landlords to have at least one degree of mercy towards their tenants. Lastly, of putting a spirit of honesty, industry, and skill into our shop-keepers, who, if a resolution could now be taken to buy only our native goods, would immediately unite to cheat and exact upon us in the price, the measure, and the goodness, nor could ever yet be brought to make one fair proposal of just dealing, though often and earnestly invited to it.\n\nTherefore I repeat, let no man talk to me of these and the like expedients, 'till he hath at least some glympse of hope, that there will ever be some hearty and sincere attempt to put them into practice.}}\n\n==Population solutions==\nGeorge Wittkowsky argued that Swift\u2019s main target in ''A Modest Proposal'' was not the conditions in Ireland, but rather the can-do spirit of the times that led people to devise a number of illogical schemes that would purportedly solve social and economic ills.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p76\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p76</ref> Swift was especially insulted by projects that tried to fix population and labour issues with a simple cure-all solution.<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift\u2019s Modest Proposal'', p85</ref> A memorable example of these sorts of schemes \"involved the idea of running the poor through a [[joint-stock company]]\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p85\"/> In response, Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' was \"a burlesque of projects concerning the poor\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsk_p88\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p88</ref> that were in vogue during the early 18th century.\n\n''A Modest Proposal'' also targets the calculating way people perceived the poor in designing their projects. The pamphlet targets reformers who \"regard people as commodities\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p101\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p101</ref> In the piece, Swift adopts the \"technique of a political arithmetician\"<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p95</ref> to show the utter ridiculousness of trying to prove any proposal with dispassionate statistics.\n\nCritics differ about Swift's intentions in using this faux-mathematical philosophy. Edmund Wilson argues that statistically \"the logic of the 'Modest proposal' can be compared with defense of crime (arrogated to Marx) in which he argues that crime takes care of the superfluous population\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p95\"/> Wittkowsky counters that Swift's satiric use of statistical analysis is an effort to enhance his satire that \"springs from a spirit of bitter mockery, not from the delight in calculations for their own sake\".<ref name=\"Wittkowsky_p98\">Wittkowsky, ''Swift's Modest Proposal'', p98</ref>\n\n==Rhetoric==\nCharles K. Smith argues that Swift's rhetorical style persuades the reader to detest the speaker and pity the Irish. Swift's specific strategy is twofold, using a \"trap\"<ref name=\"Smith_p135\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 135</ref> to create sympathy for the Irish and a dislike of the narrator who, in the span of one sentence, \"details vividly and with rhetorical emphasis the grinding poverty\" but feels emotion solely for members of his own class.<ref name=\"Smith_p136\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 136</ref> Swift's use of gripping details of poverty and his narrator's cool approach towards them create \"two opposing points of view\" that \"alienate the reader, perhaps unconsciously, from a narrator who can view with 'melancholy' detachment a subject that Swift has directed us, rhetorically, to see in a much less detached way.\"<ref name=\"Smith_p136\"/>\n\nSwift has his proposer further degrade the Irish by using language ordinarily reserved for animals. Lewis argues that the speaker uses \"the vocabulary of animal husbandry\"<ref name=\"Smith_p138\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 138</ref> to describe the Irish. Once the children have been commodified, Swift's rhetoric can easily turn \"people into animals, then meat, and from meat, logically, into tonnage worth a price per pound\".<ref name=\"Smith_p138\"/>\n\nSwift uses the proposer's serious tone to highlight the absurdity of his proposal. In making his argument, the speaker uses the conventional, textbook-approved order of argument from Swift's time (which was derived from the Latin rhetorician [[Quintilian]]).<ref name=\"Smith_p139\">Smith, ''Toward a Participatory Rhetoric'', p. 139</ref> The contrast between the \"careful control against the almost inconceivable perversion of his scheme\" and \"the ridiculousness of the proposal\" create a situation in which the reader has \"to consider just what perverted values and assumptions would allow such a diligent, thoughtful, and conventional man to propose so perverse a plan\".<ref name=\"Smith_p139\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nScholars have speculated about which earlier works Swift may have had in mind when he wrote ''A Modest Proposal''.\n\n===Tertullian's ''Apology''===\nJames Johnson argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was largely influenced and inspired by [[Tertullian]]'s ''[[Apologeticus|Apology]]'': a satirical attack against early Roman persecution of Christianity. James William Johnson believes that Swift saw major similarities between the two situations.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p563</ref> Johnson notes Swift's obvious affinity for Tertullian and the bold stylistic and structural similarities between the works ''A Modest Proposal'' and ''Apology''.<ref name=\"Johnson_p562\">Johnson, ''Tertullian and A Modest Proposal'', p562</ref> In structure, Johnson points out the same central theme, that of cannibalism and the eating of babies as well as the same final argument, that \"human depravity is such that men will attempt to justify their own cruelty by accusing their victims of being lower than human.\"<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> Stylistically, Swift and Tertullian share the same command of sarcasm and language.<ref name=\"Johnson_p563\"/> In agreement with Johnson, Donald C. Baker points out the similarity between both authors' tones and use of irony. Baker notes the uncanny way that both authors imply an ironic \"justification by ownership\" over the subject of sacrificing children\u2014Tertullian while attacking pagan parents, and Swift while attacking the English mistreatment of the Irish poor.<ref name=\"Baker_p219\">Baker, ''Tertullian and Swift's A Modest Proposal'', p219</ref>\n\n===Defoe's ''The Generous Projector''===\nIt has also been argued that ''A Modest Proposal'' was, at least in part, a response to the 1728 essay ''The Generous Projector or, A Friendly Proposal to Prevent Murder and Other Enormous Abuses, By Erecting an Hospital for Foundlings and Bastard Children'' by Swift's rival [[Daniel Defoe]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/2009/021909/books1.html | title=A modest but failed proposal | work=[[Montreal Mirror]] | date=19 February 2009 | accessdate=10 January 2012 | last=Waters | first=Juliet}}</ref>\n\n=== Mandeville's ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' ===\n[[Bernard Mandeville]]'s ''Modest Defence of Publick Stews'' asked to introduce public and state controlled [[bordello]]s.

Let it be, that they exposed them; Add to it, if you please, for this is still greater Power, ''that they begat them for their Tables to fat and eat them'': If this proves a right to do so, we may, by the same Argument, justifie Adultery, Incest and Sodomy, for there are examples of these too, both Ancient and Modern; Sins, which I suppose, have the Principle Aggravation from this, that they cross the main intention of Nature, which willeth the increase of Mankind, and the continuation of the Species in the highest perfection, and the distinction of Families, with the Security of the Marriage Bed, as necessary thereunto\" (First Treatise, sec. 59).\n\n==Economic themes==\nRobert Phiddian's article \"Have you eaten yet? The Reader in A Modest Proposal\" focuses on two aspects of ''A Modest Proposal'': the voice of Swift and the voice of the Proposer. Phiddian stresses that a reader of the pamphlet must learn to distinguish between the satiric voice of Jonathan Swift and the apparent economic projections of the Proposer. He reminds readers that \"there is a gap between the narrator's meaning and the text's, and that a moral-political argument is being carried out by means of parody\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p6</ref>\n\nWhile Swift's proposal is obviously not a serious economic proposal, George Wittkowsky, author of \"Swift's Modest Proposal: The Biography of an Early Georgian Pamphlet\", argues that to understand the piece fully, it is important to understand the economics of Swift\u2019s time. Wittowsky argues that not enough critics have taken the time to focus directly on the mercantilism and theories of labour in 18th century England. \"[I]f one regards the ''Modest Proposal'' simply as a criticism of condition, about all one can say is that conditions were bad and that Swift's irony brilliantly underscored this fact\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p3\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p3</ref>\n\n===\"People are the riches of a nation\"===\n\nAt the start of a new industrial age in the 18th century, it was believed that \"people are the riches of the nation\", and there was a general faith in an economy that paid its workers low wages because high wages meant workers would work less.<ref name=\"Phiddian_p4\">Phiddian, ''Have You Eaten Yet?'', p4</ref> Furthermore, \"in the mercantilist view no child was too young to go into industry\". In those times, the \"somewhat more humane attitudes of an earlier day had all but disappeared and the laborer had come to be regarded as a commodity\".<ref name=\"Phiddian_p6\"/>\n\nLouis A. Landa presents Swift's ''A Modest Proposal'' as a critique of the popular and unjustified maxim of mercantilism in the 18th century that \"people are the riches of a nation\".<ref name=\"Landa_p161\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p161</ref> Swift presents the dire state of Ireland and shows that mere population itself, in Ireland's case, did not always mean greater wealth and economy.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\">Landa, ''A Modest Proposal and Populousness'', p165</ref> The uncontrolled maxim fails to take into account that a person who does not produce in an economic or political way makes a country poorer, not richer.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\"/> Swift also recognises the implications of such a fact in making mercantilist philosophy a paradox: the wealth of a country is based on the poverty of the majority of its citizens.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\"/> Swift however, Landa argues, is not merely criticising economic maxims but also addressing the fact that England was denying Irish citizens their natural rights and dehumanising them by viewing them as a mere commodity.<ref name=\"Landa_p165\"/>\n\n==Modern usage==\n''A Modest Proposal'' is included in many literature programs as an example of [[Satire#Early modern western satire|early modern western satire]]. It also serves as an exceptional introduction to the concept and use of argumentative language, lending itself well to secondary and post-secondary essay courses. Outside of the realm of English studies, ''A Modest Proposal'' is a relevant piece included in many comparative and global literature and history courses, as well as those of numerous other disciplines in the arts, humanities, and even the social sciences.\n\nThe essay has been emulated many times. In his book ''A Modest Proposal'' (1984), evangelical author [[Frank Schaeffer]] emulated Swift's work in social conservative polemic against abortion and [[euthanasia]] in a future [[dystopia]] that advocated [[recycling]] of aborted [[embryos]] and [[fetuses]], as well as some disabled infants with compound intellectual, physical and physiological difficulties. (Such [[Baby Doe Rules]] cases were then a major concern of the [[pro-life]] movement of the early 1980s, which viewed selective treatment of those infants as [[disability discrimination]].) In his book ''A Modest Proposal for America'' (2013), statistician [[Howard Friedman]] opens with a satirical reflection of the extreme drive to fiscal stability by ultra-conservatives.\n\nA Modest Video Game Proposal is the title of an open letter sent by activist/former attorney [[Jack Thompson (activist)|Jack Thompson]] on October 10, 2005. He proposed that, if someone could \"create, manufacture, distribute, and sell a video game in 2006\" that allows players to play the scenario he has written, in which the character kills video game developers.<sup>[[A Modest Video Game Proposal#cite note-ModestProposal-1|[1]]]</sup>\n\n[[Hunter S. Thompson]]'s ''[[Fear and Loathing in America|Fear and Loathing in America: The Brutal Odyssey of an Outlaw Journalist]]'', which contains hundreds of private letters written by Thompson over the years, contains a letter in which he uses ''A Modest Proposal'''s satire technique against the [[Vietnam War]]. Thompson writes a letter to a local [[Aspen, Colorado|Aspen]] newspaper informing them that, on Christmas Eve, he was going to use [[napalm]] to burn a number of dogs and hopefully any humans they find. This letter protests against the burning of Vietnamese people occurring overseas.\n\nThe 2012 film ''Butcher Boys,'' written by ''[[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre]]'' co-scribe [[Kim Henkel]], is said to be loosely based on Jonathan Swift's ''A Modest Proposal.'' The film's opening scene takes place in a restaurant named \"J.

All the alkali metals react with water, with the heavier alkali metals reacting more vigorously than the lighter ones.\n\nAll of the discovered alkali metals occur in nature as their compounds: in order of [[abundance of the chemical elements|abundance]], sodium is the most abundant, followed by potassium, lithium, rubidium, caesium, and finally francium, which is very rare due to its extremely high [[radioactivity]]; francium occurs only in the minutest [[trace radioisotope|traces]] in nature as an intermediate step in some obscure side branches of the natural [[decay chain]]s. Experiments have been conducted to attempt the synthesis of [[ununennium]] (Uue), which is likely to be the next member of the group, but they have all met with failure. However, ununennium may not be an alkali metal due to [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic effects]], which are predicted to have a large influence on the chemical properties of [[superheavy element]]s; even if it does turn out to be an alkali metal, it is predicted to have some differences in physical and chemical properties from its lighter homologues.\n\nMost alkali metals have many different applications. One of the best-known applications of the pure elements is the use of rubidium and caesium in [[atomic clock]]s, of which caesium atomic clocks are the most accurate and precise representation of time. A common application of the compounds of sodium is the [[sodium-vapour lamp]], which emits very efficient light. [[Salt|Table salt]], or sodium chloride, has been used since antiquity. Sodium and potassium are also [[essential element]]s, having major biological roles as [[electrolyte]]s, and although the other alkali metals are not essential, they also have various effects on the body, both beneficial and harmful.\n__TOC__\n{{clear left}}\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Physical and chemical ===\nThe physical and chemical properties of the alkali metals can be readily explained by their having an ns<sup>1</sup> valence [[electron configuration]], which results in weak [[metallic bonding]]. Hence, all the alkali metals are soft and have low [[density|densities]],<ref name=rsc /> [[melting point|melting]]<ref name=rsc /> and [[boiling point]]s,<ref name=rsc /> as well as [[heat of sublimation|heats of sublimation]], [[heat of vaporization|vaporisation]], and [[heat of dissociation|dissociation]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|74}} They all crystallise in the [[body-centered cubic]] crystal structure,<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|73}} and have distinctive [[flame test|flame colours]] because their outer s electron is very easily excited.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}} The ns<sup>1</sup> configuration also results in the alkali metals having very large [[atomic radius|atomic]] and [[ionic radius|ionic radii]], as well as very high [[thermal conductivity|thermal]] and [[electrical conductivity]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}} Their chemistry is dominated by the loss of their lone valence electron in the outermost s-orbital to form the +1 oxidation state, due to the ease of ionising this electron and the very high second ionisation energy.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|76}} Most of the chemistry has been observed only for the first five members of the group. The chemistry of francium is not well established due to its extreme [[radioactive decay|radioactivity]];<ref name=rsc /> thus, the presentation of its properties here is limited. What little is known about francium shows that it is very close in behaviour to caesium, as expected. The physical properties of francium are even sketchier because the bulk element has never been observed; hence any data that may be found in the literature are certainly speculative extrapolations.<ref name=RubberBible84th />\n\n<center>\n<div style=\"float: center; margin: 1em;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Properties of the alkali metals<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}}<ref name=generalchemistry />\n!

Therefore, the only factor which affects the atomic radius of the alkali metals is the number of electron shells. Since this number increases down the group, the atomic radius must also increase down the group.<ref name=chemguide />\n\nThe [[ionic radius|ionic radii]] of the alkali metals are much smaller than their atomic radii. This is because the outermost electron of the alkali metals is in a different [[electron shell]] than the inner electrons, and thus when it is removed the resulting atom has one fewer electron shell and is smaller.

Since the outermost electron of alkali metals always feels the same effective nuclear charge (+1), the only factor which affects the first ionisation energy is the distance from the outermost electron to the nucleus. Since this distance increases down the group, the outermost electron feels less attraction from the nucleus and thus the first ionisation energy decreases.<ref name=chemguide /> (This trend is broken in francium due to the [[relativistic quantum chemistry|relativistic]] stabilisation and contraction of the 7s orbital, bringing francium's valence electron closer to the nucleus than would be expected from non-relativistic calculations.

This is the result of a combination of two factors: the first ionisation energies and [[atomisation energy|atomisation energies]] of the alkali metals. Because the first ionisation energy of the alkali metals decreases down the group, it is easier for the outermost electron to be removed from the atom and participate in [[chemical reaction]]s, thus increasing reactivity down the group. The atomisation energy measures the strength of the [[metallic bond]] of an element, which falls down the group as the atoms increase in [[atomic radius|radius]] and thus the metallic bond must increase in length, making the delocalised electrons further away from the attraction of the nuclei of the heavier alkali metals. Adding the atomisation and first ionisation energies gives a quantity closely related to (but not equal to) the [[activation energy]] of the reaction of an alkali metal with another substance. This quantity decreases going down the group, and so does the activation energy; thus, chemical reactions can occur faster and the reactivity increases down the group.<ref name=\"alkaliwater\">{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/reacth2o.html#top |title=Reaction of the Group 1 Elements with Water |last=Clark|first=Jim |year=2005 |work=chemguide |accessdate=18 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n=== Electronegativity ===\n{{Main|Electronegativity}}\n[[File:Periodic variation of Pauling electronegativities.png|thumb|300px|right|The variation of Pauling electronegativity (y-axis) as one descends the [[main group element|main groups]] of the periodic table from the [[period 2 element|second]] to the [[period 6 element|sixth period]]]]\nElectronegativity is a [[chemical property]] that describes the tendency of an [[atom]] or a [[functional group]] to attract [[electron]]s (or [[electron density]]) towards itself.<ref name=\"definition\">{{GoldBookRef|file=E01990|title=Electronegativity}}</ref> If the bond between [[sodium]] and [[chlorine]] in [[sodium chloride]] were [[covalent bond|covalent]], the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium.

However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them.

The first factor depends on the volume of the atom and thus the atomic radius, which increases going down the group; thus, the volume of an alkali metal atom increases going down the group. The mass of an alkali metal atom also increases going down the group. Thus, the trend for the densities of the alkali metals depends on their atomic weights and atomic radii; if figures for these two factors are known, the ratios between the densities of the alkali metals can then be calculated. The resultant trend is that the densities of the alkali metals increase down the table, with an exception at potassium. Due to having the lowest atomic weight of all the elements in their period and having the largest atomic radius for their periods, the alkali metals are the least dense metals in the periodic table.<ref name=chemguide /> Lithium, sodium, and potassium are the only three metals in the periodic table that are less dense than water:<ref name=rsc /> in fact, lithium is the least dense known solid at [[room temperature]].<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|75}}\n\n== Compounds ==\nThe alkali metals form complete series of compounds with all usually encountered anions, which well illustrate group trends.

This secondary hydrogen gas explosion produces the visible flame above the bowl of water, lake or other body of water, not the initial reaction of the metal with water (which tends to happen mostly under water).<ref name=\"alkalibangs\" /> The alkali metal hydroxides are the most basic known hydroxides.<ref name=\"Greenwood&Earnshaw\" />{{rp|87}}\n\nRecent research has suggested that the explosive behavior of alkali metals in water is driven by a [[Coulomb explosion]] rather than solely by rapid generation of hydrogen itself.<ref name=coulomb>{{cite journal |url=http://www.nature.com/nchem/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nchem.2161.html|title=Coulomb explosion during the early stages of the reaction of alkali metals with water|work=Nature Chemistry|doi=10.1038/nchem.2161|date=26 Jan 2015|volume=7|pages=250\u2013254}}</ref> All alkali metals melt as a part of the reaction with water.

They form various types of oxides, such as simple [[oxide]]s (containing the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ion), [[peroxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|2-}} ion, where there is a [[single bond]] between the two oxygen atoms), [[superoxide]]s (containing the {{chem|O|2|-}} ion), and many others. Lithium burns in air to form [[lithium oxide]], but sodium reacts with oxygen to form a mixture of [[sodium oxide]] and [[sodium peroxide]]. Potassium forms a mixture of [[potassium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]], while rubidium and caesium form the superoxide exclusively. Their reactivity increases going down the group: while lithium, sodium and potassium merely burn in air, rubidium and caesium are [[pyrophoric]] (spontaneously catch fire in air).<ref name=\"alkalireact\" />\n\nThe smaller alkali metals tend to polarise the larger anions (the peroxide and superoxide) due to their small size. This attracts the electrons in the more complex anions towards one of its constituent oxygen atoms, forming an oxide ion and an oxygen atom. This causes lithium to form the oxide exclusively on reaction with oxygen at room temperature. This effect becomes drastically weaker for the larger sodium and potassium, allowing them to form the less stable peroxides. Rubidium and caesium, at the bottom of the group, are so large that even the least stable superoxides can form. Because the superoxide releases the most energy when formed, the superoxide is preferentially formed for the larger alkali metals where the more complex anions are not polarised. (The oxides and peroxides for these alkali metals do exist, but do not form upon direct reaction of the metal with oxygen at standard conditions.)<ref name=\"alkalireact\" /> In addition, the small size of the Li<sup>+</sup> and O<sup>2\u2212</sup> ions contributes to their forming a stable ionic lattice structure. Under controlled conditions, however, all the alkali metals, with the exception of francium, are known to form their oxides, peroxides, and superoxides. The alkali metal peroxides and superoxides are powerful [[oxidising agent]]s. [[Sodium peroxide]] and [[potassium superoxide]] react with [[carbon dioxide]] to form the alkali metal carbonate and oxygen gas, which allows them to be used in [[submarine]] air purifiers; the presence of [[water vapour]], naturally present in breath, makes the removal of carbon dioxide by potassium superoxide even more efficient.<ref name=generalchemistry /><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=D.

The principal organosodium compound of commercial importance is [[sodium cyclopentadienide]].

This is in contrast to other types of [[writing system]]s, such as [[syllabary|syllabaries]] (in which each character represents a [[syllable]]) and [[logograph]]ies (in which each character represents a word, [[morpheme]], or semantic unit).\n\nThe [[Proto-Canaanite]] script, later known as the [[Phoenician alphabet]], is the first fully phonemic script. Thus the Phoenician alphabet is considered to be the first alphabet. The Phoenician alphabet is the ancestor of most modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], [[Cyrillic alphabet|Cyrillic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and possibly [[Brahmic scripts|Brahmic]].<ref name=\"Coulmas 140\"/><ref name=\"Daniels 9296\">{{harvnb|Daniels|Bright|1996|pp=92\u201396}}</ref> Under a terminological distinction promoted by [[Peter T.

In this narrow sense of the word the first \"true\" alphabet was the [[Greek alphabet]],<ref name=\"Blackwell\">{{cite book|last=Coulmas|first=Florian|title=The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Writing Systems|year=1996|publisher=[[Blackwell Publishing]] |location=Oxford|isbn=0-631-21481-X}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=396}}</ref> which was developed on the basis of the earlier [[Phoenician alphabet]]. In other alphabetic scripts such as the original Phoenician, [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] or [[Arabic script|Arabic]], letters predominantly or exclusively represent consonants; such a script is also called an [[abjad]]. A third type, called [[abugida]] or alphasyllabary, is one where vowels are shown by [[diacritic]]s or modifications of consonantal base letters, as in [[Devanagari]] and other South Asian scripts. The [[Khmer alphabet]] (for [[Cambodian language|Cambodian]]) is the longest, with 74 letters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.angmohdan.com/language-largest-alphabet/ |title=What Language Has the Largest Alphabet? |quote=Languages like Chinese, technically, do not use an alphabet but have an ideographic writing system.

According to Guinness Book of World Records, 1995, the Khmer alphabet is the largest alphabet in the world. It consists of 33 consonants, 23 vowels and 12 independent vowels.}}</ref>\n\nThere are dozens of alphabets in use today, the most popular being the [[Latin alphabet]]<ref>{{harvnb|Haarmann|2004|p=96}}</ref> (which was derived from the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]]). Many languages use modified forms of the Latin alphabet, with additional letters formed using diacritical marks.  While most alphabets have letters composed of lines ([[linear writing]]), there are also [[non-linear writing|exceptions]] such as the alphabets used in [[Braille]].\n\nAlphabets are usually associated with a standard ordering of letters. This makes them useful for purposes of [[collation]], specifically by allowing words to be sorted in [[alphabetical order]]. It also means that their letters can be used as an alternative method of \"numbering\" ordered items, in such contexts as [[numbered list]]s and number placements.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe English word ''alphabet'' came into [[Middle English]] from the [[Late Latin]] word ''alphabetum'', which in turn originated in the [[Greek language|Greek]] \u1f00\u03bb\u03c6\u03ac\u03b2\u03b7\u03c4\u03bf\u03c2 (''alphab\u0113tos'').  The Greek word was made from the first two letters, ''[[alpha (letter)|alpha]]'' and ''[[beta (letter)|beta]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/alphabet|title=alphabet|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster.com]]}}</ref>   The names for the Greek letters came from the first two letters of the [[Phoenician alphabet]]; ''[[aleph]]'', which also meant ''ox'', and ''[[bet (letter)|bet]]'', which also meant ''house''.\n\nSometimes, like in the [[alphabet song]] in English, the term \"ABCs\" is used instead of the word \"alphabet\" (''Now I know my ABCs''...).  \"Knowing one's ABCs\", in general, can be used as a metaphor for knowing the basics about anything.\n\n==History==\n{{Main article|History of the alphabet}}\n[[File:A Specimen by William Caslon.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Specimen'' of [[typeset]] [[font]]s and [[language]]s, by [[William Caslon]], letter founder; from the 1728 ''[[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Cyclopaedia]]'']]\n\n===Ancient Northeast African and Middle Eastern scripts===\nThe history of the alphabet started in [[ancient Egypt]].

An alphabetic [[cuneiform]] script with 30 signs including three that indicate the following vowel was invented in [[Ugarit]] before the 15th century BC. This script was not used after the destruction of Ugarit.<ref>''Ugaritic Writing'' [http://www.mazzaroth.com/ChapterThree/UgariticWriting.htm online]</ref>\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic script eventually developed into the [[Phoenician alphabet]], which is conventionally called \"Proto-Canaanite\" before ca. 1050 BC.<ref name=\"Daniels 9296\"/> The oldest text in Phoenician script is an inscription on the sarcophagus of King [[Ahiram]]. This script is the parent script of all western alphabets. By the tenth century, two other forms can be distinguished, namely [[Canaanite language|Canaanite]] and [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]. The Aramaic gave rise to the [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] script.<ref>{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|p=142}}</ref>  The [[South Arabian alphabet]], a sister script to the Phoenician alphabet, is the script from which the [[Ge'ez alphabet]] (an [[abugida]]) is descended. Vowelless alphabets, which are not true alphabets, are called [[abjad]]s, currently exemplified in scripts including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], and [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]]. The omission of vowels was not always a satisfactory solution and some \"weak\" consonants are sometimes used to indicate the vowel quality of a syllable ([[Mater lectionis|matres lectionis]]). These letters have a dual function since they are also used as pure consonants.<ref>{{harvnb|Coulmas|1989|p=147}}</ref>\n\nThe Proto-Sinaitic or Proto-Canaanite script and the [[Ugaritic script]] were the first scripts with a limited number of signs, in contrast to the other widely used writing systems at the time, [[Cuneiform]], [[Egyptian hieroglyphs]], and [[Linear B]]. The Phoenician script was probably the first phonemic script<ref name=\"Coulmas 140\"/><ref name=\"Daniels 9296\"/> and it contained only about two dozen distinct letters, making it a script simple enough for common traders to learn. Another advantage of Phoenician was that it could be used to write down many different languages, since it recorded words phonemically.\n\nThe script was spread by the Phoenicians across the Mediterranean.<ref name=\"Daniels 9296\" /> In Greece, the script was modified to add the vowels, giving rise to the ancestor of all alphabets in the West. The vowels have independent letter forms separate from the consonants, therefore it was the first true alphabet. The Greeks chose letters representing sounds that did not exist in Greek to represent the vowels. The vowels are significant in the Greek language, and the syllabical [[Linear B]] script that was used by the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greeks from the 16th century BC had 87 symbols including 5 vowels. In its early years, there were many variants of the Greek alphabet, a situation that caused many different alphabets to evolve from it.\n\n===European alphabets===\n[[File:ZographensisColour.jpg|thumb|[[Codex Zographensis]] in the [[Glagolitic alphabet]] from Medieval [[Bulgaria]]]]\nThe [[Greek alphabet]], in its [[Euboean alphabet|Euboean form]], was carried over by Greek colonists to the Italian peninsula, where it gave rise to a variety of alphabets used to write the [[Italic languages]]. One of these became the [[Latin alphabet]], which was spread across Europe as the Romans expanded their empire. Even after the fall of the Roman state, the alphabet survived in intellectual and religious works. It eventually became used for the descendant languages of Latin (the [[Romance languages]]) and then for most of the other languages of Europe.\n\nSome adaptations of the Latin alphabet are augmented with [[ligature (typography)|ligatures]], such as [[\u00e6]] in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Ou (letter)|\u0222]] in [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]]; by borrowings from other alphabets, such as the [[thorn (letter)|thorn]] \u00fe in [[Old English language|Old English]] and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], which came from the [[Runic alphabet|Futhark]] runes; and by modifying existing letters, such as the [[Eth (letter)|eth]] \u00f0 of Old English and Icelandic, which is a modified ''d''. Other alphabets only use a subset of the Latin alphabet, such as Hawaiian, and [[Italian language|Italian]], which uses the letters ''j, k, x, y'' and ''w'' only in foreign words.\n\nAnother notable script is [[Elder Futhark]], which is believed to have evolved out of one of the [[Old Italic alphabet]]s. Elder Futhark gave rise to a variety of alphabets known collectively as the [[Runic alphabet]]s. The Runic alphabets were used for Germanic languages from AD 100 to the late Middle Ages. Its usage is mostly restricted to engravings on stone and jewelry, although inscriptions have also been found on bone and wood. These alphabets have since been replaced with the Latin alphabet, except for decorative usage for which the runes remained in use until the 20th century.\n\nThe [[Old Hungarian script]] is a contemporary writing system of the Hungarians. It was in use during the entire history of Hungary, albeit not as an official writing system. From the 19th century it once again became more and more popular.\n\nThe [[Glagolitic alphabet]] was the initial script of the liturgical language [[Old Church Slavonic]] and became, together with the Greek uncial script, the basis of the [[Cyrillic script]]. Cyrillic is one of the most widely used modern alphabetic scripts, and is notable for its use in Slavic languages and also for other languages within the former [[Soviet Union]]. [[Cyrillic alphabets]] include the [[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian]], [[Macedonian alphabet|Macedonian]], [[Bulgarian alphabet|Bulgarian]],  [[Russian alphabet|Russian]], [[Belarusian alphabet|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian alphabet|Ukrainian]]. The Glagolitic alphabet is believed to have been created by [[Saints Cyril and Methodius]], while the Cyrillic alphabet was invented by [[Clement of Ohrid]], who was their disciple. They feature many letters that appear to have been borrowed from or influenced by the [[Greek alphabet]] and the [[Hebrew alphabet]].\n\nThe longest European alphabet is the [[Slovak alphabet]] which has 46 letters.\n\n===Asian alphabets===\nBeyond the logographic [[Written Chinese|Chinese writing]], many phonetic scripts are in existence in Asia. The [[Arabic alphabet]], [[Hebrew alphabet]], [[Syriac alphabet]], and other [[abjad]]s of the Middle East are developments of the [[Aramaic alphabet]], but because these writing systems are largely [[consonant]]-based they are often not considered true alphabets.\n\nMost alphabetic scripts of India and Eastern Asia are descended from the [[Brahmi script]], which is often believed to be a descendant of Aramaic.\n\n[[File:Zhuyin on cell phone detail.jpeg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bopomofo|Zhuyin]] on a cell phone]]\n\nIn [[Korea]], the [[Hangul]] alphabet was created by [[Sejong the Great]].<ref>\"\u4e0a\u89aa\u5236\u8afa\u6587\u4e8c\u5341\u516b\u5b57\u2026\u662f\u8b02\u8a13\u6c11\u6b63\u97f3(His majesty created 28 characters himself...

After the later establishment of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and its adoption of [[Pinyin|Hanyu Pinyin]], the use of Zhuyin today is limited, but it is still widely used in [[Taiwan]] where the Republic of China still governs. Zhuyin developed out of a form of Chinese shorthand based on Chinese characters in the early 1900s and has elements of both an alphabet and a syllabary. Like an alphabet the phonemes of [[syllable onset|syllable initials]] are represented by individual symbols, but like a syllabary the phonemes of the [[syllable rime|syllable finals]] are not; rather, each possible final (excluding the [[Syllable medial|medial glide]]) is represented by its own symbol. For example, ''luan'' is represented as \u310c\u3128\u3122 (''l-u-an''), where the last symbol \u3122 represents the entire final ''-an''. While Zhuyin is not used as a mainstream writing system, it is still often used in ways similar to a [[romanization]] system\u2014that is, for aiding in pronunciation and as an input method for Chinese characters on computers and cellphones.\n\nEuropean alphabets, especially Latin and Cyrillic, have been adapted for many languages of Asia. Arabic is also widely used, sometimes as an abjad (as with [[Urdu alphabet|Urdu]] and [[Persian alphabet|Persian]]) and sometimes as a complete alphabet (as with [[Kurdish alphabet|Kurdish]] and [[Uyghur alphabet|Uyghur]]).\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Writing systems worldwide.png|460px|thumb| \n{{aligned table|cols=4|style=font-size:90%;\n|titlestyle = font-weight:bold; font-size:105%; padding-bottom:5px\n|title = Predominant national and selected regional or minority scripts\n|row1header=y|row1style=background:lavender;font-weight:normal;text-align:center;border-right:1px #fefefe solid;\n|row2style=white-space:nowrap|fullwidth=y\n| Alphabetic | {{longitem|[[Logogram|[L]ogographic]]<br />and [[Syllabary|[S]yllabic]]}} | [[Abjad]] | [[Abugida]]\n| {{legend|#aaa|[[Latin script|Latin]]}} {{legend|#008080|[[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]]}} {{legend|blue|[[Greek alphabet|Greek]]}} {{legend|#1E90FF|[[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]]}} {{legend|#00FFFF|[[Georgian scripts|Georgian]]}} {{legend|#FF00FF|[[Hangul]]}}\n| {{legend|#8B0000|[[Hanzi]] {{smaller|[L]}}}} {{legend|#FF0000|[[Kana]] {{smaller|[S]}}{{\\}}[[Kanji]] {{smaller|[L]}}{{nbsp|2}}}} \n| {{legend|green|[[Arabic script|Arabic]]}} {{legend|#00ff7f|[[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]]}}\n| {{legend| #FFA500|[[Brahmic scripts|North Indic]]}} {{legend|#D2691E|[[Brahmic scripts|South Indic]]}} {{legend|#8B4513\n|[[Ge'ez script|Ethiopic]]}} {{legend|#808000|[[Thaana]]}} {{legend|#FFFF80|[[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Canadian syllabic]]}}\n}}]]\n{{alphabet}}\n\nThe term \"alphabet\" is used by [[Linguistics|linguists]] and [[paleographer]]s in both a wide and a narrow sense. In the wider sense, an alphabet is a script that is ''segmental'' at the [[phoneme]] level\u2014that is, it has separate glyphs for individual sounds and not for larger units such as syllables or words. In the narrower sense, some scholars distinguish \"true\" alphabets from two other types of segmental script, [[abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s. These three differ from each other in the way they treat vowels: abjads have letters for consonants and leave most vowels unexpressed; abugidas are also consonant-based, but indicate vowels with [[diacritic]]s to or a systematic graphic modification of the consonants. In alphabets in the narrow sense, on the other hand, consonants and vowels are written as independent letters.<ref>For critics of the abjad-abugida-alphabet distinction, see Reinhard G. Lehmann: \"27-30-22-26. How Many Letters Needs an Alphabet? The Case of Semitic\", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52, esp p. 22-27</ref> The earliest known alphabet in the wider sense is the [[Middle Bronze Age alphabets|Wadi el-Hol script]], believed to be an abjad, which through its successor [[Phoenician alphabet|Phoenician]] is the ancestor of modern alphabets, including [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Latin alphabet|Latin]] (via the [[Old Italic alphabet]]), [[Cyrillic]] (via the Greek alphabet) and [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]] (via [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]]).\n\nExamples of present-day abjads are the [[Arabic script|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew script]]s; true alphabets include [[Latin script|Latin]], Cyrillic, and Korean [[hangul]]; and abugidas are used to write [[tigrinya language|Tigrinya]], [[Amharic language|Amharic]], [[Hindi]], and [[Thai language|Thai]]. The [[Canadian Aboriginal syllabics]] are also an abugida rather than a syllabary as their name would imply, since each glyph stands for a consonant that is modified by rotation to represent the following vowel. (In a true syllabary, each consonant-vowel combination would be represented by a separate glyph.)\n\nAll three types may be augmented with syllabic glyphs. [[Ugaritic script|Ugaritic]], for example, is basically an abjad, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/\u0294a, \u0294i, \u0294u/}}. (These are the only time vowels are indicated.) Cyrillic is basically a true alphabet, but has syllabic letters for {{IPA|/ja, je, ju/}} (\u044f, \u0435, \u044e); [[Coptic alphabet|Coptic]] has a letter for {{IPA|/ti/}}. [[Devanagari]] is typically an abugida augmented with dedicated letters for initial vowels, though some traditions use \u0905 as a [[zero consonant]] as the graphic base for such vowels.\n\nThe boundaries between the three types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, [[Sorani]] [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] is written in the [[Arabic script]], which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the [[Phagspa script]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] was based closely on the [[Tibetan script|Tibetan abugida]], but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short ''a'' was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Tigrinya abugida]] and the [[Ge'ez alphabet|Amharic abugida]] (ironically, the original source of the term \"abugida\") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became [[logogram|logographic]]. (See below.)\n[[File:Ethiopic genesis.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Ge'ez Script]] of [[Ethiopia]] and [[Eritrea]]]]\nThus the primary [[Categorisation|classification]] of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For [[Tone (linguistics)|tonal languages]], further classification can be based on their treatment of tone, though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in [[Somali language|Somali]] and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for [[Vietnamese alphabet|Vietnamese]] (a true alphabet) and [[Thai alphabet|Thai]] (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the [[Pollard script]], an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for [[Hmong alphabet|Hmong]] and [[Zhuang alphabet|Zhuang]]. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in [[Zhuyin]] not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the [[virama]] of Indic.\n\nThe number of letters in an alphabet can be quite small. The Book [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] script, an abjad, had only twelve letters at one point, and may have had even fewer later on. Today the [[Rotokas alphabet]] has only twelve letters. (The [[Hawaiian alphabet]] is sometimes claimed to be as small, but it actually consists of 18 letters, including the [[\u02bbOkina|\u02bbokina]] and five long vowels.  However, [[Hawaiian Braille]] has only 13 letters.) While Rotokas has a small alphabet because it has few phonemes to represent (just eleven), Book Pahlavi was small because many letters had been ''conflated''\u2014that is, the graphic distinctions had been lost over time, and diacritics were not developed to compensate for this as they were in [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]], another script that lost many of its distinct letter shapes. For example, a comma-shaped letter represented ''g, d, y, k,'' or ''j''. However, such apparent simplifications can perversely make a script more complicated. In later Pahlavi [[papyrus|papyri]], up to half of the remaining graphic distinctions of these twelve letters were lost, and the script could no longer be read as a sequence of letters at all, but instead each word had to be learned as a whole\u2014that is, they had become [[logogram]]s as in Egyptian [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]].\n[[File:Greek cyrillic latin.png|left|thumb|263x263px|Circles containing the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Cyrillic Alphabet|Cyrillic]] and [[Latin alphabet|Latin Alphabets]], which share many of the same [[Letter (alphabet)|letters]], although they have different pronunciations]]\nThe largest segmental script is probably an abugida, [[Devanagari]]. When written in Devanagari, Vedic [[Sanskrit]] has an alphabet of 53 letters, including the ''visarga'' mark for final aspiration and special letters for ''k\u0161'' and ''j\u00f1,'' though one of the letters is theoretical and not actually used. The Hindi alphabet must represent both Sanskrit and modern vocabulary, and so has been expanded to 58 with the ''khutma'' letters (letters with a dot added) to represent sounds from Persian and English. Thai has a total of 59 symbols, consisting of 44 consonants, 13 vowels and 2 syllabics, not including 4 diacritics for tone marks and one for vowel length.\n\nThe largest known abjad is [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]], with 51 letters. The largest alphabets in the narrow sense include [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] and [[Abkhaz language|Abkhaz]] (for [[Cyrillic]]), with 58 and 56 letters, respectively, and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] (for the [[Latin script]]), with 46. However, these scripts either count [[digraph (orthography)|di- and tri-graphs]] as separate letters, as Spanish did with ''ch'' and ''ll'' until recently, or uses [[diacritic]]s like Slovak ''\u010d''.\n\nThe Georgian alphabet ({{lang-ka|\u10d0\u10dc\u10d1\u10d0\u10dc\u10d8}} ''{{transl|ka|Anbani}}'') is alphabetical writing system. It is the largest true alphabet where each letter is graphically independent with 33 letters{{citation needed|reason=It is unclear why having 33 (or 34? this one conflicts with the next sentence) graphically independent letters makes the Georgian alphabet the largest true one?

Original Georgian alphabet had 38 letters but 5 letters were removed in 19th century by [[Ilia Chavchavadze]]. The Georgian Alphabet is much closer to Greek than the other Caucasian alphabets. The numeric value runs parallel to the Greek one, the consonants without a Greek equivalent are organized at the end of the alphabet. Origins of the Alphabet are still unknown, some Armenian and Western scholars believe it was created by Mesrop Mashtots (Armenian: \u0544\u0565\u057d\u0580\u0578\u057a \u0544\u0561\u0577\u057f\u0578\u0581 Mesrop Ma\u0161toc')also known as Mesrob the Vartabed,who was an early medieval Armenian linguist, theologian, statesman and hymnologist, best known for inventing the Armenian alphabet c.\u2009405 AD,<ref name=\"Donald Rayfield\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VstdAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&vq=unlikely%20pre-Christian&pg=PT18#v=onepage&q=pre-Christian&f=false |first=Donald |last=Rayfield |authorlink=Donald Rayfield |title=The Literature of Georgia: A History |series=Caucasus World |year=2013 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-700-71163-5 |page=19 |quote=The Georgian alphabet seems unlikely to have a pre-Christian origin, for the major archaeological monument of the first century first century AD, the bilingual Armazi gravestone commemorating Serafita, daughter of the Georgian viceroy of Mtskheta, is inscribed in Greek and Aramaic only.

Thus a simple count of the number of distinct symbols is an important clue to the nature of an unknown script.\n\nThe Armenian alphabet ({{lang-hy|\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u0563\u0580\u0565\u0580}} ''{{transl|hy|Hayots grer}}'' or {{lang|hy|\u0540\u0561\u0575\u0578\u0581 \u0561\u0575\u0562\u0578\u0582\u0562\u0565\u0576}} ''{{transl|hy|Hayots aybuben}}'') is a graphically unique alphabetical writing system that has been used to write the Armenian language. It was introduced by Mesrob Mashdots around 405&nbsp;AD, an Armenian linguist and ecclesiastical leader, and originally contained 36 letters. Two more letters, \u0585 (o) and \u0586 (f), were added in the Middle Ages. During the 1920s orthography reform, a new letter \u0587 (capital \u0535\u054e) was added, which was a ligature before \u0565+\u0582, while the letter \u0552 \u0582 was discarded and reintroduced as part of a new letter \u0548\u0552 \u0578\u0582 (which was a digraph before).\n\n[[File:Ishkhani inscription.jpg|thumb|Old Georgian alphabet inscription on Monastery gate]]\n\nThe Armenian word for \"alphabet\" is {{lang|hy|\u0561\u0575\u0562\u0578\u0582\u0562\u0565\u0576}} ''{{transl|hy|aybuben}}'' ({{IPA-hy|\u0251jbub\u025bn}}), named after the first two letters of the Armenian alphabet \u0531 \u0561\u0575\u0562 ayb and \u0532 \u0562\u0565\u0576 ben.

The Case of Semitic\", in: The idea of writing: Writing across borders / edited by Alex de Voogt and Joachim Friedrich Quack, Leiden: Brill 2012, p. 11-52</ref> is well established, although languages using this alphabet have different conventions for their treatment of modified letters (such as the [[French language|French]] ''\u00e9'', ''\u00e0'', and ''\u00f4'') and of certain combinations of letters ([[Multigraph (orthography)|multigraphs]]). In French, these are not considered to be additional letters for the purposes of collation. However, in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], the accented letters such as ''\u00e1'', ''\u00ed'', and ''\u00f6'' are considered distinct letters representing different vowel sounds from the sounds represented by their unaccented counterparts. In Spanish, ''\u00f1'' is considered a separate letter, but accented vowels such as ''\u00e1'' and ''\u00e9'' are not. The ''ll'' and ''ch'' were also considered single letters, but in 1994 the [[Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola]] changed the collating order so that ''ll'' is between ''lk'' and ''lm'' in the dictionary and ''ch'' is between ''cg'' and ''ci'', and in 2010 the tenth congress of the [[Association of Spanish Language Academies]] changed it so they were no longer letters at all.<ref>Real Academia Espa\u00f1ola. \"Spanish Pronto!: Spanish Alphabet.\" Spanish Pronto! 22 April 2007.

Further, German words with [[umlaut (diacritic)|umlaut]] are collated ignoring the umlaut\u2014contrary to [[Turkish alphabet|Turkish]] that adopted the [[grapheme]]s '''\u00f6''' and '''\u00fc''', and where a word like ''t\u00fcfek'', would come after ''tuz'', in the dictionary. An exception is the German telephone directory where umlauts are sorted like ''\u00e4'' = ''ae'' since names as ''J\u00e4ger'' appear also with the spelling ''Jaeger'', and are not distinguished in the spoken language.\n\nThe [[Danish orthography|Danish]] and [[Norwegian orthography|Norwegian]] alphabets end with ''\u00e6''\u2014''\u00f8''\u2014''\u00e5'', whereas the Swedish and [[Finnish orthography|Finnish]] ones conventionally put ''\u00e5''\u2014''\u00e4''\u2014''\u00f6'' at the end.\n\nIt is unknown whether the earliest alphabets had a defined sequence. Some alphabets today, such as the [[Hanuno'o script]], are learned one letter at a time, in no particular order, and are not used for [[collation]] where a definite order is required. However, a dozen [[Ugaritic alphabet|Ugaritic]] tablets from the fourteenth century BC preserve the alphabet in two sequences. One, the ''ABCDE'' order later used in Phoenician, has continued with minor changes in [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]], [[Armenian alphabet|Armenian]], [[Gothic alphabet|Gothic]], [[Cyrillic]], and [[Latin alphabet|Latin]]; the other, ''HM\u0126LQ,'' was used in southern Arabia and is preserved today in [[Ge'ez alphabet|Ethiopic]].<ref>{{harvnb|Millard|1986|p=395}}</ref> Both orders have therefore been stable for at least 3000 years.\n\n[[Runic alphabet|Runic]] used an unrelated [[Elder Futhark|Futhark]] sequence, which was later [[Younger Futhark|simplified]]. [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]] uses its own sequence, although Arabic retains the traditional [[abjadi order]] for numbering.\n\nThe [[Brahmic family]] of alphabets used in India use a unique order based on [[phonology]]: The letters are arranged according to how and where they are produced in the mouth. This organization is used in Southeast Asia, Tibet, Korean [[hangul]], and even Japanese [[kana]], which is not an alphabet.\n\n==Names of letters==\nThe Phoenician letter names, in which each letter was associated with a word that begins with that sound ([[acrophony]]), continue to be used to varying degrees in [[Samaritan alphabet|Samaritan]], [[Aramaic alphabet|Aramaic]], [[Syriac alphabet|Syriac]], [[Hebrew alphabet|Hebrew]], [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]].\n\nThe names were abandoned in [[Latin alphabet|Latin]], which instead referred to the letters by adding a vowel (usually e) before or after the consonant; the two exceptions were [[Y]] and [[Z]], which were borrowed from the Greek alphabet rather than Etruscan, and were known as ''Y Graeca'' \"Greek Y\" (pronounced ''I Graeca'' \"Greek I\") and ''zeta'' (from Greek)\u2014this discrepancy was inherited by many European languages, as in the term ''zed'' for Z in all forms of English other than American English. Over time names sometimes shifted or were added, as in ''double U'' for [[W]] (\"double V\" in French), the English name for Y, and American ''zee'' for Z. Comparing names in English and French gives a clear reflection of the [[Great Vowel Shift]]: A, B, C and D are pronounced /e\u026a, bi\u02d0, si\u02d0, di\u02d0/ in today's English, but in contemporary French they are /a, be, se, de/. The French names (from which the English names are derived) preserve the qualities of the English vowels from before the Great Vowel Shift. By contrast, the names of F, L, M, N and S (/\u025bf, \u025bl, \u025bm, \u025bn, \u025bs/) remain the same in both languages, because \"short\" vowels were largely unaffected by the Shift.\n\nIn Cyrillic originally the letters were given names based on Slavic words; this was later abandoned as well in favor of a system similar to that used in Latin.\n\n==Orthography and pronunciation==\n{{main article|Phonemic orthography}}\nWhen an alphabet is adopted or developed to represent a given language, an [[orthography]] generally comes into being, providing rules for the [[spelling]] of words in that language. In accordance with the principle on which alphabets are based, these rules will generally map letters of the alphabet to the [[phoneme]]s (significant sounds) of the spoken language. In a perfectly [[phonemic orthography]] there would be a consistent one-to-one correspondence between the letters and the phonemes, so that a writer could predict the spelling of a word given its pronunciation, and a speaker would always know the pronunciation of a word given its spelling, and vice versa. However this ideal is not usually achieved in practice; some languages (such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) come close to it, while others (such as English) deviate from it to a much larger degree.\n\nThe pronunciation of a language often evolves independently of its writing system, and writing systems have been borrowed for languages they were not designed for, so the degree to which letters of an alphabet correspond to phonemes of a language varies greatly from one language to another and even within a single language.\n\nLanguages may fail to achieve a one-to-one correspondence between letters and sounds in any of several ways:\n* A language may represent a given phoneme by a combination of letters rather than just a single letter. Two-letter combinations are called [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] and three-letter groups are called [[trigraph (orthography)|trigraphs]]. [[German language|German]] uses the [[tetragraph]]s (four letters) \"tsch\" for the phoneme {{IPA-de|t\u0283|}} and (in a few borrowed words) \"dsch\" for {{IPA|[d\u0292]}}. [[Kabardian language|Kabardian]] also uses a tetragraph for one of its phonemes, namely \"\u043a\u0445\u044a\u0443\". Two letters representing one sound occur in several instances in Hungarian as well (where, for instance, ''cs'' stands for [t\u0283], ''sz'' for [s], ''zs'' for [\u0292], ''dzs'' for [d\u0292]).\n* A language may represent the same phoneme with two or more different letters or combinations of letters. An example is [[modern Greek]] which may write the phoneme {{IPA-el|i|}} in six different ways: {{angbr|\u03b9}}, {{angbr|\u03b7}}, {{angbr|\u03c5}}, {{angbr|\u03b5\u03b9}}, {{angbr|\u03bf\u03b9}}, and {{angbr|\u03c5\u03b9}} (though the last is rare).\n* A language may spell some words with unpronounced letters that exist for historical or other reasons. For example, the spelling of the Thai word for \"beer\" [\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e35\u0e22\u0e23\u0e4c] retains a letter for the final consonant \"r\" present in the English word it was borrowed from, but silences it.\n* Pronunciation of individual words may change according to the presence of surrounding words in a sentence ([[sandhi]]).\n* Different dialects of a language may use different phonemes for the same word.\n* A language may use different sets of symbols or different rules for distinct sets of vocabulary items, such as the Japanese [[hiragana]] and [[katakana]] syllabaries, or the various rules in English for spelling words from Latin and Greek, or the original [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] vocabulary.\n\nNational languages sometimes elect to address the problem of dialects by simply associating the alphabet with the national standard. However, with an international language with wide variations in its dialects, such as [[English language|English]], it would be impossible to represent the language in all its variations with a single phonetic alphabet.\n\nSome national languages like [[Finnish language|Finnish]], [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]] and [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]) and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] have a very regular spelling system with a nearly one-to-one correspondence between letters and phonemes. Strictly speaking, these national languages lack a word corresponding to the verb \"to spell\" (meaning to split a word into its letters), the closest match being a verb meaning to split a word into its syllables. Similarly, the [[Italian language|Italian]] verb corresponding to 'spell (out)', ''compitare'', is unknown to many Italians because spelling is usually trivial, as Italian spelling is highly phonemic. In standard [[Spanish language|Spanish]], one can tell the pronunciation of a word from its spelling, but not vice versa, as certain phonemes can be represented in more than one way, but a given letter is consistently pronounced. [[French language|French]], with its [[silent letter]]s and its heavy use of [[nasal vowel]]s and [[elision]], may seem to lack much correspondence between spelling and pronunciation, but its rules on pronunciation, though complex, are actually consistent and predictable with a fair degree of accuracy.\n\nAt the other extreme are languages such as English, where the pronunciations of many words simply have to be memorized as they do not correspond to the spelling in a consistent way. For English, this is partly because the [[Great Vowel Shift]] occurred after the orthography was established, and because English has acquired a large number of loanwords at different times, retaining their original spelling at varying levels. Even English has general, albeit complex, rules that predict pronunciation from spelling, and these rules are successful most of the time; rules to predict spelling from the pronunciation have a higher failure rate.\n\nSometimes, countries have the written language undergo a [[spelling reform]] to realign the writing with the contemporary spoken language. These can range from simple spelling changes and word forms to switching the entire writing system itself, as when [[Turkey]] switched from the Arabic alphabet to a Latin-based [[Turkish alphabet]].\n\nThe standard system of symbols used by [[linguist]]s to represent sounds in any language, independently of orthography, is called the [[International Phonetic Alphabet]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{colbegin|3}}\n* ''[[A Is For Aardvark]]''\n* [[Abecedarium]]\n* [[Acrophony]]\n* [[Akshara]]\n* [[Alphabet book]]\n* [[Alphabet effect]]\n* [[Alphabet song]]\n* [[Alphabetical order]]\n* ''[[Butterfly Alphabet]]''\n* [[Character encoding]]\n* [[Constructed script]]\n* [[Cyrillic]]\n* [[English alphabet]]\n* [[Hangul]]\n* [[NATO phonetic alphabet|ICAO (NATO) spelling alphabet]]\n* [[Lipogram]]\n* [[List of alphabets]]\n* [[Pangram]]\n* [[Thai script#Alphabet listing|Thai script]]\n* [[Thoth]]\n* [[Transliteration]]\n* [[Unicode]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last =Coulmas |first=Florian |title=The Writing Systems of the World |publisher=Blackwell Publishers Ltd. |year=1989 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VOywmavmZ3UC|isbn=0-631-18028-1|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Daniels |first1=Peter T. |last2=Bright |first2=William |title=The World's Writing Systems |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1996 |isbn=0-19-507993-0 |ref=harv}} Overview of modern and some ancient writing systems.\n* {{cite book |author =Driver, G.

Both the concept of atomic number and the Bohr model were thereby given scientific credence.]]\n\nThe '''atomic number''' or '''proton number''' (symbol '''''Z''''') of a [[chemical element]] is the number of [[proton]]s found in the [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of an [[atom]]. It is identical to the [[charge number]] of the nucleus. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an [[electric charge|uncharged]] atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of [[electron]]s.\n\nThe sum of the atomic number ''Z'' and the [[neutron number|number of neutrons]], ''N'', gives the [[mass number]] ''A'' of an atom. Since protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass (and the mass of the electrons is negligible for many purposes) and the [[Binding energy#Mass change|mass defect]] of nucleon binding is always small compared to the nucleon mass, the [[atomic mass]] of any atom, when expressed in [[Atomic mass unit|unified atomic mass units]] (making a quantity called the \"[[atomic mass|relative isotopic mass]]\"), is within 1% of the whole number ''A''.\n\nAtoms with the same atomic number ''Z'' but different neutron numbers ''N'', and hence different atomic masses, are known as [[isotope]]s. A little more than three-quarters of naturally occurring elements exist as a mixture of isotopes (see [[monoisotopic element]]s), and the average isotopic mass of an isotopic mixture for an element (called the relative atomic mass) in a defined environment on Earth, determines the element's standard [[atomic weight]]. Historically, it was these atomic weights of elements (in comparison to hydrogen) that were the quantities measurable by chemists in the 19th century.\n\nThe conventional symbol ''Z'' comes from the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|'''''Z'''ahl''}} meaning ''number'', which, prior to the modern synthesis of ideas from chemistry and physics, merely denoted an element's numerical place in the [[periodic table]], whose order is approximately, but not completely, consistent with the order of the elements by atomic weights. Only after 1915, with the suggestion and evidence that this ''Z'' number was also the nuclear charge and a physical characteristic of atoms, did the word {{lang|de|''Atom'''z'''ahl''}} (and its English equivalent ''atomic number'') come into common use in this context.\n\n==History==\n\n===The periodic table and a natural number for each element===\n[[File:DIMendeleevCab.jpg|150px|left|thumb|Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev created a periodic table of the elements that ordered them numerically by atomic weight, yet occasionally used chemical properties in contradiction to weight.]]\nLoosely speaking, the existence or construction of a [[periodic table]] of elements creates an ordering of the elements, and so they can be numbered in order.\n\n[[Dmitri Mendeleev]] claimed that he arranged his first periodic tables in order of [[atomic weight]] (\"Atomgewicht\").<ref name=\"dm1869\">[http://www.aip.org/history/curie/periodic.htm The Periodic Table of Elements], American Institute of Physics</ref> However, in consideration of the elements' observed chemical properties, he changed the order slightly and placed [[tellurium]] (atomic weight 127.6) ahead of [[iodine]] (atomic weight 126.9).<ref name=\"dm1869\"/><ref>[http://www.rsc.org/chemsoc/visualelements/pages/history_ii.html The Development of the Periodic Table], Royal Society of Chemistry</ref> This placement is consistent with the modern practice of ordering the elements by proton number, ''Z'', but that number was not known or suspected at the time.\n\nA simple numbering based on periodic table position was never entirely satisfactory, however. Besides the case of iodine and tellurium, later several other pairs of elements (such as argon and potassium, cobalt and nickel) were known to have nearly identical or reversed atomic weights, thus requiring their placement in the periodic table to be determined by their chemical properties. However the gradual identification of more and more chemically similar [[lanthanide]] elements, whose atomic number was not obvious, led to inconsistency and uncertainty in the periodic numbering of elements at least from [[lutetium]] (element 71) onwards ([[hafnium]] was not known at this time).\n\n[[File:Niels Bohr.jpg|140px|left|thumb|Niels Bohr's 1913 [[Bohr model]] of the atom required van den Broek's atomic number of nuclear charges, and Bohr believed that Moseley's work contributed greatly to the acceptance of the model.]]\n[[File:Henry Moseley.jpg|140px|thumb|Henry Moseley helped develop the concept of atomic number by showing experimentally (1913) that \nVan den Broek's 1911 hypothesis combined with the [[Bohr model]] nearly correctly predicted atomic X-ray emissions.]]\n\n===The Rutherford-Bohr model and van den Broek===\nIn 1911, [[Ernest Rutherford]] gave a [[Rutherford model|model]] of the atom in which a central core held most of the atom's mass and a positive charge which, in units of the electron's charge, was to be approximately equal to half of the atom's atomic weight, expressed in numbers of hydrogen atoms. This central charge would thus be approximately half the atomic weight (though it was almost 25% different from the atomic number of gold {{nowrap|1=(''Z'' = 79}}, {{nowrap|1=''A'' = 197}}), the single element from which Rutherford made his guess). Nevertheless, in spite of Rutherford's estimation that gold had a central charge of about 100 (but was element {{nowrap|1=''Z'' = 79}} on the periodic table), a month after Rutherford's paper appeared, [[Antonius van den Broek]] first formally suggested that the central charge and number of electrons in an atom was ''exactly'' equal to its place in the periodic table (also known as element number, atomic number, and symbolized ''Z''). This proved eventually to be the case.\n\n=== Moseley's 1913 experiment ===\nThe experimental position improved dramatically after research by [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913.<ref>[http://www.rsc.org/Education/Teachers/Resources/periodictable/pre16/order.doc Ordering the Elements in the Periodic Table], Royal Chemical Society</ref> Moseley, after discussions with Bohr who was at the same lab (and who had used Van den Broek's hypothesis in his [[Bohr model]] of the atom), decided to test Van den Broek's and Bohr's hypothesis directly, by seeing if [[spectral line]]s emitted from excited atoms fitted the Bohr theory's postulation that the frequency of the spectral lines be proportional to the square of ''Z''.\n\nTo do this, Moseley measured the wavelengths of the innermost photon transitions (K and L lines) produced by the elements from aluminum (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;13) to gold (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;79) used as a series of movable anodic targets inside an [[x-ray tube]].<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://www.chemistry.co.nz/henry_moseley_article.htm |doi=10.1080/14786441308635052 |title=XCIII.The high-frequency spectra of the elements |journal=Philosophical Magazine Series 6 |volume=26 |issue=156 |pages=1024 |year=1913 |last1=Moseley |first1=H.G.J. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100122022821/http://www.materials.manchester.ac.uk/research/facilities/moseley/biography/ |archivedate=22 January 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> The square root of the frequency of these photons (x-rays) increased from one target to the next in an arithmetic progression. This led to the conclusion ([[Moseley's law]]) that the atomic number does closely correspond (with an offset of one unit for K-lines, in Moseley's work) to the calculated [[electric charge]] of the nucleus, i.e. the element number ''Z''. Among other things, Moseley demonstrated that the [[lanthanide]] series (from [[lanthanum]] to [[lutetium]] inclusive) must have 15 members\u2014no fewer and no more\u2014which was far from obvious from the chemistry at that time.\n\n===Missing elements===\nAfter Moseley's death in 1915, the atomic numbers of all known elements from hydrogen to uranium (''Z'' = 92) were examined by his method. There were seven elements (with ''Z'' < 92) which were not found and therefore identified as still undiscovered, corresponding to atomic numbers 43, 61, 72, 75, 85, 87 and 91.<ref>[[Eric Scerri]], ''A tale of seven elements,'' (Oxford University Press 2013) {{ISBN|978-0-19-539131-2}}, p.47</ref> From 1918 to 1947, all seven of these missing elements were discovered.<ref>Scerri chaps. 3\u20139 (one chapter per element)</ref> By this time the first four transuranium elements had also been discovered, so that the periodic table was complete with no gaps as far as curium (''Z'' = 96).\n\n===The proton and the idea of nuclear electrons===\nIn 1915 the reason for nuclear charge being quantized in units of ''Z'', which were now recognized to be the same as the element number, was not understood. An old idea called [[Prout's hypothesis]] had postulated that the elements were all made of residues (or \"protyles\") of the lightest element hydrogen, which in the Bohr-Rutherford model had a single electron and a nuclear charge of one. However, as early as 1907 Rutherford and [[Thomas Royds]] had shown that alpha particles, which had a charge of +2, were the nuclei of helium atoms, which had a mass four times that of hydrogen, not two times. If Prout's hypothesis were true, something had to be neutralizing some of the charge of the hydrogen nuclei present in the nuclei of heavier atoms.\n\nIn 1917 Rutherford succeeded in generating hydrogen nuclei from a [[nuclear reaction]] between alpha particles and nitrogen gas,<ref>[http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/ernest-rutherford Ernest Rutherford | NZHistory.net.nz, New Zealand history online]. Nzhistory.net.nz (19 October 1937). Retrieved on 2011-01-26.</ref> and believed he had proven Prout's law. He called the new heavy nuclear particles protons in 1920 (alternate names being proutons and protyles). It had been immediately apparent from the work of Moseley that the nuclei of heavy atoms have more than twice as much mass as would be expected from their being made of [[hydrogen]] nuclei, and thus there was required a hypothesis for the neutralization of the extra [[protons]] presumed present in all heavy nuclei. A helium nucleus was presumed to be composed of four protons plus two \"nuclear electrons\" (electrons bound inside the nucleus) to cancel two of the charges. At the other end of the periodic table, a nucleus of gold with a mass 197 times that of hydrogen, was thought to contain 118 nuclear electrons in the nucleus to give it a residual charge of + 79, consistent with its atomic number.\n\n===The discovery of the neutron makes ''Z'' the proton number===\nAll consideration of nuclear electrons ended with [[James Chadwick]]'s discovery of the neutron in 1932. An atom of gold now was seen as containing 118 neutrons rather than 118 nuclear electrons, and its positive charge now was realized to come entirely from a content of 79 protons. After 1932, therefore, an element's atomic number ''Z'' was also realized to be identical to the [[proton number]] of its nuclei.\n\n==The symbol of ''Z''==\nThe conventional symbol ''Z'' possibly comes from the [[German language|German]] word {{lang|de|''Atom'''z'''ahl''}} (atomic number).<ref>[http://antoine.frostburg.edu/chem/senese/101/atoms/faq/why-is-atomic-number-Z.shtml Origin of symbol Z]. frostburg.edu</ref> However, prior to 1915, the word ''Zahl'' (simply ''number'') was used for an element's assigned number in the periodic table.\n\n==Chemical properties==\nEach element has a specific set of chemical properties as a consequence of the number of electrons present in the neutral atom, which is ''Z'' (the atomic number). The [[electron configuration|configuration]] of these electrons follows from the principles of [[quantum mechanics]]. The number of electrons in each element's [[electron shell]]s, particularly the outermost [[valence shell]], is the primary factor in determining its [[chemical bonding]] behavior. Hence, it is the atomic number alone that determines the chemical properties of an element; and it is for this reason that an element can be defined as consisting of ''any'' mixture of atoms with a given atomic number.\n\n==New elements==\nThe quest for new elements is usually described using atomic numbers. As of 2010, all elements with atomic numbers 1 to 118 have been observed. Synthesis of new elements is accomplished by bombarding target atoms of heavy elements with ions, such that the sum of the atomic numbers of the target and ion elements equals the atomic number of the element being created. In general, the [[half-life]] becomes shorter as atomic number increases, though an \"[[island of stability]]\" may exist for undiscovered isotopes with certain numbers of protons and neutrons.\n\n==See also==\n{{wiktionary|atomic number}}\n*[[History of the periodic table]]\n*[[Effective atomic number]]\n*[[Atomic theory]]\n*[[Prout's hypothesis]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Atomic Number}}\n<!--Categories-->\n[[Category:Chemical properties]]\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Atoms]]\n[[Category:Dimensionless numbers of chemistry]]", "sha1": "bycdgaos7djqbjte1ivcjdau2c5g87a"}}, {"title": "Anatomy", "ns": "0", "id": "674", "revision": {"id": "795925601", "parentid": "795919713", "timestamp": "2017-08-17T11:05:38Z", "contributor": {"username": "CFCF", "id": "2387886"}, "comment": "Reverted to revision 793553942 by [[Special:Contributions/InternetArchiveBot|InternetArchiveBot]] ([[User talk:InternetArchiveBot|talk]]): I'd prefer we keep this out [[WP:GLOBAL]].

(''Non-P'' and ''non-Q'' designate the opposite propositions to ''P'' and ''Q''.)  This is known as logical [[contraposition]]. Symbolically:\n\n<math>(P \\to Q)\\leftrightarrow (\\neg Q \\to \\neg P)</math>\n\nThe name ''affirming the [[consequent]]'' derives from the premise ''Q'', which affirms the \"then\" clause of the [[indicative conditional|conditional]] premise.\n\n==Examples==\n'''Example 1'''\n\nOne way to demonstrate the invalidity of this argument form is with a counterexample with true premises but an obviously false conclusion.  For example:\n\n:If someone owns [[United States Bullion Depository|Fort Knox]], then he is [[Wealth|rich]].\n:[[Bill Gates]] is rich.\n:Therefore, Bill Gates owns Fort Knox.\n\nOwning Fort Knox is not the ''only'' way to be rich.  Any number of other ways exist to be rich.\n\nHowever, one can affirm with certainty that \"if someone is not rich\" (''non-Q''), then \"this person does not own Fort Knox\" (''non-P''). This is the [[contrapositive]] of the first statement, and it must be true if and only if the original statement is true.\n\n'''Example 2'''\n\nArguments of the same form can sometimes seem superficially convincing, as in the following example:\n\n:If I have the [[flu]], then I have a [[sore throat]].\n:I have a sore throat.\n:Therefore, I have the flu.\n\nBut having the flu is not the ''only'' cause of a sore throat since many illnesses cause sore throat, such as the [[common cold]] or [[strep throat]].\n\nAffirming the consequent is commonly used in [[rationalization (psychology)|rationalization]], and thus appears as a [[coping mechanism]] in some people.\n\n'''Example 3'''\n\nIn Joseph Heller's ''Catch-22'',<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Catch-22|last=Heller|first=Joseph|publisher=Vintage|year=1994|isbn=0-09-947731-9|location=|pages=438, 8}}</ref> the chaplain is interrogated for supposedly being 'Washinton Irving'/'Irving Washington', who has been blocking out large portions of soldier's letters home.

His father left the family in 1937, subsequently volunteering for the army in 1941. Tarkovsky stayed with his mother, moving with her and his sister Marina to Moscow, where she worked as a proofreader at a printing press. In 1939 Tarkovsky enrolled at the Moscow School \u2116 554. During the war, the three evacuated to [[Yuryevets, Ivanovo Oblast|Yuryevets]], living with his maternal grandmother. In 1943 the family returned to Moscow. Tarkovsky continued his studies at his old school, where the poet [[Andrey Voznesensky]] was one of his classmates. He studied piano at a music school and attended classes at an art school.

Before 1953, annual film production was low and most films were directed by veteran directors. After 1953, more films were produced, many of them by young directors. The [[Khrushchev Thaw]] relaxed Soviet social restrictions a bit and permitted a limited influx of European and North American literature, films and music. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of the [[Italian neorealism|Italian neorealists]], [[French New Wave]], and of directors such as [[Akira Kurosawa|Kurosawa]], [[Luis Bu\u00f1uel|Bu\u00f1uel]], [[Ingmar Bergman|Bergman]], [[Robert Bresson|Bresson]], [[Andrzej Wajda]] (whose film ''[[Ashes and Diamonds (film)|Ashes and Diamonds]]'' influenced Tarkovsky) and [[Kenji Mizoguchi|Mizoguchi]]. Tarkovsky absorbed the idea of the [[auteur theory|auteur]] as a necessary condition for creativity.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n\nTarkovsky's teacher and mentor was [[Mikhail Romm]], who taught many film students who would later become influential film directors. In 1956 Tarkovsky directed his first student short film, ''[[The Killers (1956 film)|The Killers]]'', from a short story of [[Ernest Hemingway]]. The short film ''[[There Will Be No Leave Today]]'' and the [[screenplay]] ''[[Concentrate (screenplay)|Concentrate]]'' followed in 1958 and 1959.\n\nAn important influence on Tarkovsky was the film director [[Grigori Chukhrai]], who was teaching at the VGIK. Impressed by the talent of his student, Chukhrai offered Tarkovsky a position as assistant director for his film ''Clear Skies''. Tarkovsky initially showed interest but then decided to concentrate on his studies and his own projects.<ref name=\"kompravda\" />\n\nDuring his third year at the VGIK, Tarkovsky met [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. They found much in common as they liked the same film directors and shared ideas on cinema and films. In 1959 they wrote the script ''Antarctica \u2013 Distant Country'', which was later published in the ''[[Moskovskij Komsomolets]]''. Tarkovsky submitted the script to [[Lenfilm]], but it was rejected. They were more successful with the script ''[[The Steamroller and the Violin]]'', which they sold to [[Mosfilm]]. This became Tarkovsky's graduation project, earning him his diploma in 1960 and winning First Prize at the New York Student Film Festival in 1961.\n\n==Career==\n===Film career in the Soviet Union===\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He had inherited the film from director Eduard Abalov, who had to abort the project. The film earned Tarkovsky international acclaim and won the [[Golden Lion]] award at the [[Venice Film Festival]] in the year 1962. In the same year, on 30 September, his first son Arseny (called Senka in Tarkovsky's diaries) Tarkovsky was born.\n[[File:Tarkovsky vgik.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Monument to Andrei Tarkovsky at entrance of [[Gerasimov Institute of Cinematography]]]]\nIn 1965, he directed the film ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' about the life of [[Andrei Rublev]], the fifteenth-century Russian [[iconography|icon painter]]. ''Andrei Rublev'' was not, except for a single screening in Moscow in 1966, immediately released after completion due to problems with Soviet authorities. Tarkovsky had to cut the film several times, resulting in several different versions of varying lengths. A version of the film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1969 and won the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]]. The film was widely released in the Soviet Union in a cut version in 1971.\n\nHe divorced his wife, [[Irma Raush]], in June 1970. In the same year, he married [[Larisa Tarkovskaya|Larissa Kizilova]] (n\u00e9e Egorkina), who had been a production assistant for the film ''Andrei Rublev'' (they had been living together since 1965). Their son, Andrei Andreyevich Tarkovsky, was born in the same year on 7 August.<ref>{{Cite book | last=Gianvito | first=John | title=Andrei Tarkovsky: Interviews ([[Conversations with Filmmakers Series]]) | year=2006 | publisher=University Press of Mississippi | location= | isbn=1-57806-220-9 | pages=XXV}}\n</ref>\n\nIn 1972, he completed ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'', an adaptation of the novel ''[[Solaris (novel)|Solaris]]'' by [[Stanis\u0142aw Lem]]. He had worked on this together with screenwriter [[Fridrikh Gorenshtein]] as early as 1968. The film was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], won the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]] and the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]], and was nominated for the [[Palme d'Or]]. From 1973 to 1974, he shot the film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', a highly autobiographical and unconventionally structured film drawing on his childhood and incorporating some of his father's poems. Tarkovsky had worked on the screenplay for this film since 1967, under the consecutive titles ''Confession'', ''White day'' and ''A white, white day''. From the beginning the film was not well received by Soviet authorities due to its content and its perceived elitist nature. Russian authorities placed the film in the \"third category,\" a severely limited distribution, and only allowed it to be shown in third-class cinemas and workers' clubs. Few prints were made and the film-makers received no returns. Third category films also placed the film-makers in danger of being accused of wasting public funds, which could have serious effects on their future productivity.<ref>Marshall, Herbert.

T. A. Hoffmann]]. In December 1976, he directed ''[[Hamlet]]'', his only stage play, at the [[Lenkom Theatre]] in Moscow. The main role was played by [[Anatoly Solonitsyn]], who also acted in several of Tarkovsky's films. At the end of 1978, he also wrote the screenplay ''Sardor'' together with the writer Aleksandr Misharin.\n\nThe last film Tarkovsky completed in the Soviet Union was ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'', inspired by the novel ''[[Roadside Picnic]]'' by the brothers [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]]. Tarkovsky had met the brothers first in 1971 and was in contact with them until his death in 1986. Initially he wanted to shoot a film based on their novel ''[[Dead Mountaineer's Hotel]]'' and he developed a raw script. Influenced by a discussion with Arkady Strugatsky he changed his plan and began to work on the script based on ''Roadside Picnic''. Work on this film began in 1976. The production was mired in troubles; improper development of the negatives had ruined all the exterior shots. Tarkovsky's relationship with cinematographer [[Georgy Rerberg]] deteriorated to the point where he hired [[Alexander Knyazhinsky]] as a new first cinematographer. Furthermore, Tarkovsky suffered a heart attack in April 1978, resulting in further delay. The film was completed in 1979 and won the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury at the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nIn the same year Tarkovsky also began the production of the film ''The First Day'' (Russian: \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0414\u0435\u043d\u044c ''Pervyj Dyen\u2032''), based on a script by his friend and long-term collaborator [[Andrei Konchalovsky]]. The film was set in 18th-century Russia during the reign of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] and starred [[Natalya Bondarchuk]] and [[Anatoli Papanov]]. To get the project approved by [[Goskino]], Tarkovsky submitted a script that was different from the original script, omitting several scenes that were critical of the [[Religion in the Soviet Union|official atheism in the Soviet Union]]. After shooting roughly half of the film the project was stopped by Goskino after it became apparent that the film differed from the script submitted to the censors.

At the end of the year he was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. In January 1986, he began treatment in Paris and was joined there by his son, who was finally allowed to leave the Soviet Union. ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was presented at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] and received the [[Grand Prix (Cannes Film Festival)|Grand Prix Sp\u00e9cial du Jury]], the [[FIPRESCI|FIPRESCI prize]] and the Prize of the Ecumenical Jury. As Tarkovsky was unable to attend due to his illness, the prizes were collected by his son, Andrei Jr.\n[[File:Gravestone of Andrei Tarkovsky 2007.jpg|thumb|Andrei and Larisa Tarkovsky's grave, [[Sainte-Genevi\u00e8ve-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]] in France]]\nIn Tarkovsky's last [[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|diary]] entry (15 December 1986), he wrote: \"But now I have no strength left \u2013 that is the problem\". The diaries are sometimes also known as ''[[Time Within Time: The Diaries 1970-1986|Martyrolog]]'' and were published posthumously in 1989 and in English in 1991.\n\nTarkovsky died in Paris on 29 December 1986.

Evidence for this hypothesis includes testimonies by former KGB agents who claim that [[Viktor Chebrikov]] gave the order to eradicate Tarkovsky to curtail what the Soviet government and the KGB saw as [[anti-Soviet propaganda]] by Tarkovsky. Other evidence includes several memoranda that surfaced after the [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|1991 coup]] and the claim by one of Tarkovsky's doctors that his cancer could not have developed from a natural cause.<ref>Komsolmoskaya Pravda, \"New Tarkovsky documents surface\", 15.

During his career he directed only seven feature films, as well as three shorts from his time at VGIK. He also wrote several screenplays. He furthermore directed the play ''[[Hamlet]]'' for the stage in Moscow, directed the opera ''[[Boris Godunov (opera)|Boris Godunov]]'' in London, and he directed a radio production of the short story ''Turnabout'' by [[William Faulkner]]. He also wrote ''[[Sculpting in Time]]'', a book on film theory.\n\nTarkovsky's first feature film was ''[[Ivan's Childhood]]'' in 1962. He then directed ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'' in 1966, ''[[Solaris (1972 film)|Solaris]]'' in 1972, ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'' in 1975 and ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]'' in 1979. The documentary ''[[Voyage in Time]]'' was produced in Italy in 1982, as was ''[[Nostalghia]]'' in 1983. His last film ''[[The Sacrifice]]'' was produced in Sweden in 1986. Tarkovsky was personally involved in writing the screenplays for all his films, sometimes with a cowriter. Tarkovsky once said that a director who realizes somebody else's screenplay without being involved in it becomes a mere illustrator, resulting in dead and monotonous films.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Tarkovsky |first=Andrei |title=Lectures on Film Directing (notes from classes taught by Tarkovsky at the State Institute of Cinematography) |journal=Iskusstvo Kino |year=1990 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/Directing.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Illg |first=Jerzy |title=Z Andriejem Tarkowskim rozmawiaj\u0105 Jerzy Illg, Leonard Neuger |journal=Res Publica |volume=1 |pages=137\u2013160 |location=Warsaw |year=1987 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/interview.html}}</ref>\n\nA book of 60 photos, ''Instant Light, Tarkovsky Polaroids'', taken by Tarkovsky in Russia and Italy between 1979 and 1984 was published in 2006.

The screenplay is based on the life and work of German author [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]. In 1974 an acquaintance from [[Tallinnfilm]] approached Tarkovsky to write a screenplay on a German theme. Tarkovsky considered [[Thomas Mann]] and E.T.A. Hoffmann, and also thought about [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]]'s ''[[Peer Gynt]]''. In the end Tarkovsky signed a contract for a script based on the life and work of Hoffmann. Tarkovsky planned to write the script during the summer of 1974 at his [[dacha]]. Writing was not without difficulty, less than a month before the deadline he had not written a single page. He finally finished the project in late 1974 and submitted the final script to Tallinnfilm in October.<ref name=wpowell>{{cite book\n  | last = Tarkovsky\n  | first = Andrei\n  | authorlink = \n  |author2=edited by William Powell\n  | title = Collected Screenplays\n  | publisher = Faber & Faber\n  | year = 1999\n  | location = London\n  | pages = \n  | url = \n  | doi = \n  | id = \n  | isbn = }}\n</ref>\n\nAlthough the script was well received by the officials at Tallinnfilm, it was the consensus that no one but Tarkovsky would be able to direct it. The script was sent to [[Goskino]] in February 1976, and although approval was granted for proceeding with making the film the screenplay was never realized. In 1984, during the time of his exile in the West, Tarkovsky revisited the screenplay and made a few changes. He also considered to finally direct a film based on the screenplay but ultimately dropped this idea.<ref name=\"wpowell\"/>\n\n==Influences==\nTarkovsky became a film director during the mid and late 1950s, a period referred to as the [[Khrushchev Thaw]], during which Soviet society opened to foreign films, literature and music, among other things. This allowed Tarkovsky to see films of European, American and Japanese directors, an experience which influenced his own film making. His teacher and mentor at the film school, [[Mikhail Romm]], allowed his students considerable freedom and emphasized the independence of the film director.\n\nTarkovsky was, according to fellow student Shavkat Abdusalmov, fascinated by Japanese films. He was amazed by how every character on the screen is exceptional and how everyday events such as a Samurai cutting bread with his sword are elevated to something special and put into the limelight.<ref>{{cite book |last=Abdusalamov |first=Shavkat |author2=translated by Sergei Sossinsky |title=Feedback Effects, in About Andrei Tarkovsky, Memoirs and Biographies |publisher=Progress Publishers |year=1990 |location=Moscow |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Japanese_Influences.html |isbn=5-01-001973-6}}</ref> Tarkovsky has also expressed interest in the art of Haiku and its ability to create \"images in such a way that they mean nothing beyond themselves.\"<ref>Tarkovsky, Andrei.

The reason is that Tarkovsky saw film as an art as only a relatively recent phenomenon, with the early film-making forming only a prelude. The list has also no films or directors from Tarkovsky's native Russia, although he rated Soviet directors such as [[Boris Barnet]], [[Sergei Parajanov]] and [[Alexander Dovzhenko]] highly.\n\nAlthough strongly opposed to commercial cinema, in a famous exception Tarkovsky praised the blockbuster film ''[[The Terminator]]'', saying its \"vision of the future and the relation between man and its destiny is pushing the frontier of cinema as an art\". He was critical of the \"brutality and low acting skills\", but nevertheless impressed by this film.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" />\n\n==Cinematic style==\nIn a 1962 interview, Tarkovsky argued, \"All art, of course, is intellectual, but for me, all the arts, and cinema even more so, must above all be emotional and act upon the heart.\"{{sfn|Gianvito|2006|p=5}} His films are characterized by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] themes, extremely [[long take]]s, and images often considered by critics to be of exceptional beauty. Recurring motifs are dreams, memory, childhood, running water accompanied by fire, rain indoors, reflections, levitation, and characters re-appearing in the foreground of long panning movements of the camera. He once said, \"Juxtaposing a person with an environment that is boundless, collating him with a countless number of people passing by close to him and far away, relating a person to the whole world, that is the meaning of cinema.\u201d\n\nTarkovsky incorporated levitation scenes into several of his films, most notably ''Solaris''. To him these scenes possess great power and are used for their photogenic value and magical inexplicability.<ref>{{Cite news |last=de Brantes |first=Charles |title=La foi est la seule chose qui puisse sauver l'homme |newspaper=La France Catholique |date=20 June 1986 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_On.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref> Water, clouds, and reflections were used by him for their surreal beauty and photogenic value, as well as their symbolism, such as waves or the forms of brooks or running water.<ref>{{cite press release |title=English Programme Booklet for ''The Sacrifice'' |publisher=Swedish Film Institute |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/AT_For_Dummies.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref> Bells and candles are also frequent symbols. These are symbols of film, sight and sound, and Tarkovsky's film frequently has themes of self-reflection.{{Original research inline|date=April 2017}}\n\nTarkovsky developed a theory of cinema that he called \"sculpting in time\". By this he meant that the unique characteristic of cinema as a medium was to take our experience of time and alter it. Unedited movie footage transcribes time in [[Real-time (media)|real time]]. By using long takes and few cuts in his films, he aimed to give the viewers a sense of time passing, time lost, and the relationship of one moment in time to another.\n\nUp to, and including, his film ''[[The Mirror (1975 film)|Mirror]]'', Tarkovsky focused his cinematic works on exploring this theory. After ''Mirror'', he announced that he would focus his work on exploring the [[dramatic unities]] proposed by [[Aristotle]]: a concentrated action, happening in one place, within the span of a single day.\n\nSeveral of Tarkovsky's films have color or black and white sequences. This first occurs in the otherwise monochrome ''[[Andrei Rublev (film)|Andrei Rublev]]'', which features a color epilogue of [[Andrei Rublev|Rublev's]] authentic religious icon paintings. All of his films afterwards contain monochrome, and in ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker's]]'' case [[Sepia tone|sepia]] sequences, while otherwise being in color. In 1966, in an interview conducted shortly after finishing ''Andrei Rublev'', Tarkovsky dismissed color film as a \"commercial gimmick\" and cast doubt on the idea that contemporary films meaningfully use color. He claimed that in everyday life one does not consciously notice colors most of the time, and that color should therefore be used in film mainly to emphasize certain moments, but not all the time, as this distracts the viewer. To him, films in color were like moving paintings or photographs, which are too beautiful to be a realistic depiction of life.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chugunova |first=Maria |title=On Cinema \u2013 Interview with Tarkovsky |journal=To the Screen |date=December 1966 |url=http://www.acs.ucalgary.ca/~tstronds/nostalghia.com/TheTopics/On_Color.html |accessdate=14 January 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Vadim Yusov===\nTarkovsky worked in close collaboration with cinematographer [[Vadim Yusov]] from 1958 to 1972, and much of the visual style of Tarkovsky's films can be attributed to this collaboration.<ref>List of Noted Film Director And Cinematographer Collaborations: Andrei Tarkovsky Vadim Yusov, Museum of Learning.

Dover Publications (1966), p 27.</ref>]]\n\n'''Ambiguity''' is a type of [[uncertainty]] of [[meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] in which several interpretations are [[wikt:plausible#Adjective|plausible]]. It is thus an attribute of any idea or statement whose [[intention|intended]] meaning cannot be definitively resolved according to a rule or process with a finite number of steps. (The ''[[wikt:ambi-#Prefix|ambi]]-'' part of the [[Terminology|term]] reflects an idea of \"[[2 (number)|two]]\", as in \"two meanings\".)\n\nThe concept of ambiguity is generally contrasted with [[vagueness]]. In ambiguity, specific and distinct interpretations are permitted (although some may not be immediately obvious), whereas with information that is vague, it is difficult to form any interpretation at the desired level of specificity.\n\nContext may play a role in resolving ambiguity. For example, the same piece of information may be ambiguous in one context and unambiguous in another.\n\n== Linguistic forms ==\n[[File:Structural analysis of an ambiguous spanish sentence.svg|thumb|Structural analysis of an ambiguous Spanish sentence:<br /> '''Pepe vio a Pablo enfurecido'''<br />Interpretation 1: When Pepe was angry, then he saw Pablo<br />Interpretation 2: Pepe saw that Pablo was angry.<br />Here, the syntactic tree in figure represents interpretation 2.]]\n\nThe [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]] of a word or phrase pertains to its having more than one meaning in the language to which the word belongs. \"Meaning\" here refers to whatever should be captured by a good dictionary. For instance, the word \"bank\" has several distinct lexical definitions, including \"[[Bank|financial institution]]\" and \"[[Bank (geography)|edge of a river]]\". Or consider  \"[[apothecary]]\". One could say \"I bought herbs from the apothecary\". This could mean one actually spoke to the apothecary ([[pharmacist]]) or went to the apothecary ([[pharmacy]]).\n\nThe context in which an ambiguous word is used often makes it evident which of the meanings is intended. If, for instance, someone says \"I buried $100 in the bank\", most people would not think someone used a shovel to dig in the mud. However, some linguistic contexts do not provide sufficient information to disambiguate a used word.\n\nLexical ambiguity can be addressed by algorithmic methods that automatically associate the appropriate meaning with a word in context, a task referred to as [[word sense disambiguation]].\n\nThe use of multi-defined words requires the author or speaker to clarify their context, and sometimes elaborate on their specific intended meaning (in which case, a less ambiguous term should have been used). The goal of clear concise communication is that the receiver(s) have no misunderstanding about what was meant to be conveyed. An exception to this could include a politician whose \"[[weasel word]]s\" and [[obfuscation]] are necessary to gain support from multiple [[Electoral district|constituents]] with [[mutually exclusive]] conflicting desires from their candidate of choice. Ambiguity is a powerful tool of [[political science]].\n\nMore problematic are words whose senses express closely related concepts. \"Good\", for example, can mean \"useful\" or \"functional\" (''That's a good hammer''), \"exemplary\" (''She's a good student''), \"pleasing\" (''This is good soup''), \"moral\" (''a good person'' versus ''the lesson to be learned from a story''), \"[[righteous]]\", etc. \" I have a good daughter\" is not clear about which sense is intended. The various ways to apply [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es can also create ambiguity (\"unlockable\" can mean \"capable of being unlocked\" or \"impossible to lock\").\n\n[[Syntactic ambiguity]] arises when a sentence can have two (or more) different meanings because of the structure of the sentence\u2014its syntax.  This is often due to a modifying expression, such as a prepositional phrase, the application of which is unclear. \"He ate the cookies on the couch\", for example, could mean that he ate those cookies that were on the couch (as opposed to those that were on the table), or it could mean that he was sitting on the couch when he ate the cookies.  \"To get in, you will need an entrance fee of $10 or your voucher and your drivers' license.\"  This could mean that you need EITHER ten dollars OR BOTH your voucher and your license.  Or it could mean that you need your license AND you need EITHER ten dollars OR a voucher.  Only rewriting the sentence, or placing appropriate punctuation can resolve a syntactic ambiguity.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Critical Thinking, 10th ed., Ch 3, Moore, Brooke N. and Parker, Richard.  McGraw-Hill, 2012</ref>\nFor the notion of, and theoretic results about, syntactic ambiguity in artificial, [[formal languages]] (such as computer [[programming language]]s), see [[Ambiguous grammar]].\n\n[[Spoken language]] can contain many more types of ambiguities which are called phonological ambiguities, where there is more than one way to compose a set of sounds into words. For example, \"ice cream\" and \"I scream\". Such ambiguity is generally resolved according to the context. A mishearing of such, based on incorrectly resolved ambiguity, is called a [[mondegreen]].\n\n[[Semantic ambiguity]] happens when a sentence contains an ambiguous word or phrase\u2014a word or phrase that has more than one meaning.   In \"We saw her duck\" (example due to Richard Nordquist), the word \"duck\" can refer either\n# to the person's bird (the noun \"duck\", modified by the possessive pronoun \"her\"), or\n# to a motion she made (the verb \"duck\", the subject of which is the objective pronoun \"her\", object of the verb \"saw\").<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nFor example, \"You could do with a new automobile. How about a test drive?\" The clause \"You could do with\" presents a statement with such wide possible interpretation as to be essentially meaningless.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Lexical ambiguity is contrasted with semantic ambiguity. The former represents a choice between a finite number of known and meaningful context-dependent interpretations. The latter represents a choice between any number of possible interpretations, none of which may have a standard agreed-upon meaning. This form of ambiguity is closely related to [[vagueness]].\n\nLinguistic ambiguity [[Ambiguity (law)|can be a problem in law]], because the interpretation of written documents and oral agreements is often of paramount importance.\n\nPhilosophers (and other users of logic) spend a lot of time and effort searching for and removing (or intentionally adding) ambiguity in arguments because it can lead to incorrect conclusions and can be used to deliberately conceal bad arguments. For example, a politician might say, \"I oppose taxes which hinder economic growth\", an example of a glittering generality. Some will think he opposes taxes in general because they hinder economic growth. Others may think he opposes only those taxes that he believes will hinder economic growth. In writing, the sentence can be rewritten to reduce possible misinterpretation, either by adding a comma after \"taxes\" (to convey the first sense) or by changing \"which\" to \"that\" (to convey the second sense) or by rewriting it in other ways. The devious politician hopes that each constituent will interpret the statement in the most desirable way, and think the politician supports everyone's opinion. However, the opposite can also be true \u2013 an opponent can turn a positive statement into a bad one if the speaker uses ambiguity (intentionally or not). The logical fallacies of amphiboly and equivocation rely heavily on the use of ambiguous words and phrases.\n\nIn continental philosophy (particularly phenomenology and existentialism), there is much greater tolerance of ambiguity, as it is generally seen as an integral part of the human condition. Martin Heidegger argued that the relation between the subject and object is ambiguous, as is the relation of mind and body, and part and whole.[3] In Heidegger's phenomenology, Dasein is always in a meaningful world, but there is always an underlying background for every instance of signification. Thus, although some things may be certain, they have little to do with Dasein's sense of care and existential anxiety, e.g., in the face of death. In calling his work Being and Nothingness an \"essay in phenomenological ontology\" Jean-Paul Sartre follows Heidegger in defining the human essence as ambiguous, or relating fundamentally to such ambiguity. Simone de Beauvoir tries to base an ethics on Heidegger's and Sartre's writings (The Ethics of Ambiguity), where she highlights the need to grapple with ambiguity: \"as long as philosophers and they [men] have thought, most of them have tried to mask it...And the ethics which they have proposed to their disciples have always pursued the same goal. It has been a matter of eliminating the ambiguity by making oneself pure inwardness or pure externality, by escaping from the sensible world or being engulfed by it, by yielding to eternity or enclosing oneself in the pure moment.\" Ethics cannot be based on the authoritative certainty given by mathematics and logic, or prescribed directly from the empirical findings of science. She states: \"Since we do not succeed in fleeing it, let us, therefore, try to look the truth in the face. Let us try to assume our fundamental ambiguity. It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our life that we must draw our strength to live and our reason for acting\". Other continental philosophers suggest that concepts such as life, nature, and sex are ambiguous. Corey Anton has argued that we cannot be certain what is separate from or unified with something else: language, he asserts, divides what is not, in fact, separate. Following Ernest Becker, he argues that the desire to 'authoritatively disambiguate' the world and existence have led to numerous ideologies and historical events such as genocide. On this basis, he argues that ethics must focus on 'dialectically integrating opposites' and balancing tension, rather than seeking a priori validation or certainty. Like the existentialists and phenomenologists, he sees the ambiguity of life as the basis of creativity.\n\nIn literature and rhetoric, ambiguity can be a useful tool. Groucho Marx's classic joke depends on a grammatical ambiguity for its humor, for example: \"Last night I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got in my pajamas, I'll never know\". Songs and poetry often rely on ambiguous words for artistic effect, as in the song title \"Don't It Make My Brown Eyes Blue\" (where \"blue\" can refer to the color, or to sadness).\n\nIn narrative, ambiguity can be introduced in several ways: motive, plot, character. F. Scott Fitzgerald uses the latter type of ambiguity with notable effect in his novel ''The Great Gatsby''.\n\nChristianity and Judaism employ the concept of paradox synonymously with 'ambiguity'. Many Christians and Jews endorse Rudolf Otto's description of the sacred as 'mysterium tremendum et fascinans', the awe-inspiring mystery which fascinates humans.[dubious \u2013 discuss] The orthodox Catholic writer G. K. Chesterton regularly employed paradox to tease out the meanings in common concepts which he found ambiguous, or to reveal meaning often overlooked or forgotten in common phrases. (The title of one of his most famous books, Orthodoxy, itself employing such a paradox.)\n\nMetonymy involves the use of the name of a subcomponent part as an abbreviation, or jargon, for the name of the whole object (for example \"wheels\" to refer to a car, or \"flowers\" to refer to beautiful offspring, an entire plant, or a collection of blooming plants). In modern vocabulary critical semiotics,[9] metonymy encompasses any potentially ambiguous word substitution that is based on contextual contiguity (located close together), or a function or process that an object performs, such as \"sweet ride\" to refer to a nice car. Metonym miscommunication is considered a primary mechanism of linguistic humour.\n\n== Music ==\nIn [[music]], pieces or sections which confound expectations and may be or are interpreted simultaneously in different ways are ambiguous, such as some [[polytonality]], [[polymeter]], other ambiguous [[metre|meters]] or [[rhythm]]s, and ambiguous [[phrase (music)|phrasing]], or (Stein 2005, p.&nbsp;79) any [[aspect of music]]. The [[music of Africa]] is often purposely ambiguous. To quote [[Donald Francis Tovey|Sir Donald Francis Tovey]] (1935, p.&nbsp;195), \"Theorists are apt to vex themselves with vain efforts to remove uncertainty just where it has a high aesthetic value.\"\n\n== Visual art ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\n[[File:Necker cube.svg|The [[Necker cube]], an ambiguous image|thumb]]\nIn visual art, certain images are visually ambiguous, such as the [[Necker cube]], which can be interpreted in two ways. Perceptions of such objects remain stable for a time, then may flip, a phenomenon called [[multistable perception]].\nThe opposite of such ambiguous images are [[impossible object]]s.\n\nPictures or photographs may also be ambiguous at the semantic level: the visual image is unambiguous, but the meaning and narrative may be ambiguous: is a certain facial expression one of excitement or fear, for instance?\n\n== Constructed language ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}\nSome [[Constructed language|languages have been created]] with the intention of avoiding ambiguity, especially [[Polysemy|lexical ambiguity]]. [[Lojban]] and [[Loglan]] are two related languages which have been created for this, focusing chiefly on syntactic ambiguity as well. The languages can be both spoken and written. These languages are intended to provide a greater technical precision over big natural languages, although historically, such attempts at language improvement have been criticized. Languages composed from many diverse sources contain much ambiguity and inconsistency. The many exceptions to [[syntax]] and [[semantic]] rules are time-consuming and difficult to learn.\n\n== Computer science ==\nIn computer science, the [[SI prefix]]es [[kilo-]], [[mega-]] and [[giga-]] were historically used in certain contexts to mean either the first three powers of 1024 (1024, 1024<sup>2</sup> and 1024<sup>3</sup>) contrary to the [[metric system]] in which these units unambiguously mean one thousand, one million, and one billion. This usage is particularly prevalent with electronic memory devices (e.g. [[DRAM]]) addressed directly by a binary machine register where a decimal interpretation makes no practical sense.\n\nSubsequently, the Ki, Mi, and Gi prefixes were introduced so that [[metric prefix#Binary prefixes|binary prefixes]] could be written explicitly, also rendering k, M, and G ''unambiguous'' in texts conforming to the new standard \u2014 this led to a ''new'' ambiguity in engineering documents lacking outward trace of the binary prefixes (necessarily indicating the new style) as to whether the usage of k, M, and G remains ambiguous (old style) or not (new style). Note also that 1 M (where M is ambiguously 1,000,000 or 1,048,576) is ''less'' uncertain than the engineering value 1.0e6 (defined to designate the interval 950,000 to 1,050,000), and that as non-volatile storage devices began to commonly exceed 1 GB in capacity (where the ambiguity begins to routinely impact the second significant digit), GB and TB almost always mean 10<sup>9</sup> and 10<sup>12</sup> [[bytes]].\n\n== Mathematical notation ==\n[[Mathematical notation]], widely used in [[physics]] and other [[science]]s, avoids many ambiguities compared to expression in natural language. However, for various reasons, several [[Lexical (semiotics)|lexical]], [[syntactic]] and [[semantic]] ambiguities remain.\n\n=== Names of functions ===\nThe '''ambiguity''' in the style of writing a [[Function (mathematics)|function]] should not be confused with a [[multivalued function]], which can (and should) be defined in a deterministic and unambiguous way. Several [[special function]]s still do not have established notations. Usually, the conversion to another notation requires to scale the argument or the resulting value; sometimes, the same name of the function is used, causing confusions. Examples of such underestablished functions:\n* [[Sinc function]]\n* [[Elliptic integral#Complete elliptic integral of the third kind|Elliptic integral of the third kind]]; translating elliptic integral form [[MAPLE]] to [[Mathematica]], one should replace the second argument to its square, see [[Talk:Elliptic integral#List of notations]]; dealing with complex values, this may cause problems.\n* [[Exponential integral]]<ref name=\"irene\">{{cite book |first1=M. |last1=Abramovits |first2=I. |last2=Stegun |title=Handbook on mathematical functions |page= 228 |url=http://www.math.sfu.ca/~cbm/aands/page_228.htm }}</ref>\n* [[Hermite polynomial]]<ref name=\"irene\"/>{{rp|775}}\n\n=== Expressions ===\nAmbiguous expressions often appear in physical and mathematical texts.\nIt is common practice to omit multiplication signs in mathematical expressions. Also, it is common to give the same name to a variable and a function, for example, <math>f=f(x)</math>. Then, if one sees <math>f=f(y+1)</math>, there is no way to distinguish whether it means <math>f=f(x)</math> '''multiplied''' by <math>(y+1)</math>, or function <math>f</math> '''evaluated''' at argument equal to <math>(y+1)</math>. In each case of use of such notations, the reader is supposed to be able to perform the deduction and reveal the true meaning.\n\nCreators of algorithmic languages try to avoid ambiguities. Many algorithmic languages ([[C++]] and [[Fortran]]) require the character * as symbol of multiplication. The [[Wolfram Language]] used in [[Mathematica]] allows the user to omit the multiplication symbol, but requires square brackets to indicate the argument of a function; square brackets are not allowed for grouping of expressions. Fortran, in addition, does not allow use of the same name (identifier) for different objects, for example, function and variable; in particular, the expression '''f=f(x)''' is qualified as an error.\n\nThe order of operations may depend on the context. In most [[programming language]]s, the operations of division and multiplication have equal priority and are executed from left to right. Until the last century, many editorials assumed that multiplication is performed first, for example, <math>a/bc</math> is interpreted as <math>a/(bc)</math>; in this case, the insertion of parentheses is required when translating the formulas to an algorithmic language. In addition, it is common to write an argument of a function without parenthesis, which also may lead to ambiguity.\nSometimes, one uses ''italics'' letters to denote elementary functions.\nIn the [[scientific journal]] style, the expression\n<math> s i n \\alpha</math>\nmeans\nproduct of variables\n<math>s</math>,\n<math>i</math>,\n<math>n</math> and\n<math>\\alpha</math>, although in a slideshow, it may mean <math>\\sin[\\alpha]</math>.\n\nA comma in subscripts and superscripts sometimes is omitted; it is also ambiguous notation.\nIf it is written <math>T_{mnk}</math>, the reader should guess from the context, does it mean a single-index object, evaluated while the subscript is equal to product of variables\n<math>m</math>, <math>n</math> and <math>k</math>, or it is indication to a trivalent tensor.\nThe writing of <math>T_{mnk}</math> instead of <math>T_{m,n,k}</math> may mean that the writer either is stretched in space (for example, to reduce the publication fees) or aims to increase number of publications without considering readers. The same may apply to any other use of ambiguous notations.\n\nSubscripts are also used to denote the argument to a function, as in <math>F_{x}</math>.\n<!--\nSome scientific journals use superscripts to indicate citations. If one cites reference number 6 about [[coherent addition of lasers]], the centenve may read as follows:\nPractically, the number of lasers, which can be combined in such a way, does not exceed 10<sup>6</sup>.\n\"Oh, this very powerful method allows for the combination of a million lasers,\"\nthe reader may think. To avoid such ambiguity, [[citations]] in Wikipedia appear inside square bracket <sup>[1]</sup>.\n!-->\n\n=== Examples of potentially confusing ambiguous mathematical expressions ===\n<math>\\sin^2\\alpha/2</math>, which could be understood to mean either <math>(\\sin(\\alpha/2))^2</math> or <math>(\\sin(\\alpha))^2/2</math>. In addition, <math>\\sin^2(x)</math> may mean <math>\\sin(\\sin(x))</math>, as <math>\\exp^2(x)</math> means <math>\\exp(\\exp(x))</math> (see [[tetration]]).\n\n<math>\\sin^{-1}\\alpha</math>, which by convention means <math>\\arcsin(\\alpha)</math>, though it might be thought to mean <math>(\\sin(\\alpha))^{-1}</math>, since <math>\\sin^{n} \\alpha</math> means <math>(\\sin(\\alpha))^{n}</math>.\n\n<math>a/2b</math>, which arguably should mean <math>(a/2)b</math> but would commonly be understood to mean <math>a/(2b)</math> .\n\n=== Notations in quantum optics and quantum mechanics ===\nIt is common to define the [[coherent states]] in [[quantum optics]] with <math>~|\\alpha\\rangle~ </math> and states with fixed number of photons with <math>~|n\\rangle~</math>. Then, there is an \"unwritten rule\": the state is coherent if there are more Greek characters than Latin characters in the argument, and <math>~n~</math>photon state if the Latin characters dominate. The ambiguity becomes even worse, if <math>~|x\\rangle~</math> is used for the states with certain value of the coordinate, and <math>~|p\\rangle~</math> means the state with certain value of the momentum, which may be used in books on [[quantum mechanics]]. Such ambiguities easily lead to confusions, especially if some normalized [[adimensional]], [[dimensionless]] variables are used. Expression <math> |1\\rangle </math> may mean a state with single photon, or the coherent state with mean amplitude equal to 1, or state with momentum equal to unity, and so on. The reader is supposed to guess from the context.\n\n=== Ambiguous terms in physics and mathematics ===\nSome physical quantities do not yet have established notations; their value (and sometimes even [[dimension]], as in the case of the [[Einstein coefficients]]), depends on the system of notations. Many terms are ambiguous. Each use of an ambiguous term should be preceded by the definition, suitable for a specific case. Just like [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] states in [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]: \"... Only in the context of a proposition has a name meaning.\"<ref>{{cite book |last=Wittgenstein |first=Ludwig |title=Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus |page=39 |publisher=Dover Publications Inc. |year=1999 |isbn=0-486-40445-5 }}</ref>\n\nA highly confusing term is ''gain''. For example, the sentence \"the gain of a system should be doubled\", without context, means close to nothing.<br />\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output voltage of an electric circuit to the input voltage should be doubled.<br />\nIt may mean that the ratio of the output power of an electric or optical circuit to the input power should be doubled.<br />\nIt may mean that the gain of the laser medium should be doubled, for example, doubling the population of the upper laser level in a quasi-two level system (assuming negligible absorption of the ground-state).\n\nThe term ''intensity'' is ambiguous when applied to light. The term can refer to any of [[irradiance]], [[luminous intensity]], [[radiant intensity]], or [[radiance]], depending on the background of the person using the term.\n\nAlso, confusions may be related with the use of [[atomic percent]] as measure of concentration of a [[dopant]], or [[Optical resolution|resolution]] of an imaging system, as measure of the size of the smallest detail which still can be resolved at the background of statistical noise.

Its body is stout with a prominently arched back<ref name=UR1>{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=452}}</ref> and is sparsely covered with coarse hairs. The limbs are of moderate length, with the rear legs being longer than the forelegs.<ref name=UR/> The front feet have lost the pollex (or 'thumb'), resulting in four toes, while the rear feet have all five toes. Each toe bears a large, robust [[Nail (anatomy)|nail]] which is somewhat flattened and shovel-like, and appears to be intermediate between a [[claw]] and a hoof. Whereas the aardvark is considered [[digitigrade]], it appears at time to be [[plantigrade]]. This confusion happens because when it squats it stands on its soles.<ref name=UR1/>\n\nAn aardvark's weight is typically between {{convert|60|and(-)|80|kg}}.<ref name=UR/> An aardvark's length is usually between {{convert|105|and(-)|130|cm|ft}},<ref name=EoM/> and can reach lengths of {{convert|2.2|m}} when its tail (which can be up to {{convert|70|cm}}) is taken into account. It is {{convert|60|cm|in}} tall at the shoulder, and has a girth of about {{convert|100|cm|ft}}.<ref name=UR1/> It is the [[Largest organisms|largest]] member of the proposed clade [[Afroinsectiphilia]]. The aardvark is pale yellowish-gray in color and often stained reddish-brown by [[soil]]. The aardvark's coat is thin, and the animal's primary protection is its tough skin. Its hair is short on its head and tail; however its legs tend to have longer hair.<ref name=EoM/> The hair on the majority of its body is grouped in clusters of 3-4 hairs.<ref name=UR1/> The hair surrounding its nostrils is dense to help filter particulate matter out as it digs. Its tail is very thick at the base and gradually tapers.\n\n===Head===\nThe greatly elongated head is set on a short, thick neck, and the end of the snout bears a disc, which houses the nostrils. It contains a thin but complete [[zygomatic arch]].<ref name=UR1/> The head of the aardvark contains many unique and different features. One of the most distinctive characteristics of the Tubulidentata is their [[Tooth|teeth]]. Instead of having a [[pulp (tooth)|pulp cavity]], each tooth has a cluster of thin, hexagonal, upright, parallel tubes of vasodentin (a modified form of [[dentine]]), with individual pulp canals, held together by [[cementum]].<ref name=UR/> The number of columns is dependent on the size of the tooth, with the largest having about 1,500.<ref name=UR2/> The teeth have no [[Tooth enamel|enamel]] coating and are worn away and regrow continuously.<ref name=sho1/> The aardvark is born with conventional incisors and [[canine tooth|canines]] at the front of the jaw, which fall out and are not replaced. Adult aardvarks have only cheek teeth at the back of the [[jaw]], and have a [[dentition|dental formula]] of: {{DentalFormula|upper=0.0.2-3.3|lower=0.0.2.3}} These remaining teeth are peg-like and rootless and are of unique composition.<ref>{{harvnb|Martin|1983|p=377}}</ref> The teeth consist of 14 upper and 12 lower jaw molars.<ref name=Colliers/> The nasal area of the aardvark is another unique area, as it contains ten [[nasal concha]]e, more than any other placental mammal.<ref name=UR/>\n\nThe sides of the nostrils are thick with hair.<ref name=UR1/> The tip of the snout is highly mobile and is moved by modified [[mimetic muscles]].<ref name=UR/> The fleshy dividing tissue between its nostrils probably has sensory functions,<ref name=EoM/> but it is uncertain whether they are olfactory or vibratory in nature.<ref name=UR6>{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=458}}</ref> Its nose is made up of more [[turbinate]] bones than any other mammal, with between 9 and 11, compared to dogs with 4 to 5.<ref name=sho1/> With a large quantity of turbinate bones, the aardvark has more space for the moist [[epithelium]], which is the location of the olfactory bulb.<ref name=sho1/> The nose contains nine [[olfactory bulb]]s, more than any other mammal.<ref name=UR1/> Its keen sense of smell is not just from the quantity of bulbs in the nose but also in the development of the brain, as its [[olfactory lobe]] is very developed.<ref name=UR2>{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|pp=453\u2013454}}</ref> The snout resembles an elongated pig snout.

The time spent in the intestine of the aardvark helps the fertility of the seed, and the fruit provides needed moisture for the aardvark.<ref name=sho1/><ref name=UR6/> They avoid eating the African [[driver ant]] and red ants.<ref name=UR4/> Due to their stringent diet requirements, they require a large range to survive.<ref name=UR3/> An aardvark emerges from its burrow in the late afternoon or shortly after sunset, and forages over a considerable home range encompassing {{convert|10|to|30|km|mi}}. While foraging for food, the aardvark will keep its nose to the ground and its ears pointed forward, which indicates that both smell and hearing are involved in the search for food. They zig-zag as they forage and will usually not repeat a route for 5\u20138 days as they appear to allow time for the termite nests to recover before feeding on it again.<ref name=UR4/>\n\nDuring a foraging period, they will stop and dig a \"V\" shaped trench with their forefeet and then sniff it profusely as a means to explore their location.<ref name=EoM/> When a concentration of ants or termites is detected, the aardvark digs into it with its powerful front legs, keeping its long ears upright to listen for predators, and takes up an astonishing number of [[insect]]s with its long, sticky tongue\u2014as many as 50,000 in one night have been recorded. Its claws enable it to dig through the extremely hard crust of a termite or ant mound quickly. It avoids inhaling the dust by sealing the nostrils.<ref name=ez/> When successful, the aardvark's long (up to {{convert|30|cm|in}})<ref name=EB/> tongue licks up the insects; the termites' biting, or the ants' stinging attacks are rendered futile by the tough skin. After an aardvark visit at a termite mound, other animals will visit to pick up all the leftovers.<ref name=UR5>{{harvnb|Rahm|1990|p=457}}</ref> Termite mounds alone don't provide enough food for the aardvark, so they look for termites that are on the move. When these insects move, they can form columns {{convert|10|-|40|m|ft}} long and these tend to provide easy pickings with little effort exerted by the aardvark. These columns are more common in areas of livestock or other hoofed animals.<ref name=UR5/> The trampled grass and dung attract termites from [[Odontotermes]], [[Microtermes]], and [[Pseudacanthotermes]] genera.<ref name=UR5/>\n\nOn a nightly basis they tend to be more active during the first portion of the night time (20:00-00:00); however, they don't seem to prefer bright or dark nights over the other.

If one is not close it will dig a new one rapidly. This new one will be short and require the aardvark to back out when the coast is clear.<ref name=UR4/>\n\n===Movement===\nThe aardvark is known to be a good swimmer and has been witnessed successfully swimming in strong currents.<ref name=UR4/> It can dig a yard of tunnel in about five minutes,<ref name=UR3/> but otherwise moves fairly slowly.\n\nWhen leaving the burrow at night, they pause at the entrance for about ten minutes, sniffing and listening. After this period of watchfulness, it will bound out and within seconds it will be {{convert|10|m|ft}} away. It will then pause, prick its ears, twisting its head to listen, then jump and move off to start foraging.<ref name=UR3/>\n\nAside from digging out ants and termites, the aardvark also [[fossorial|excavates]] burrows in which to live; of which they generally fall into three categories: burrows made while foraging, refuge and resting location, and permanent homes.<ref name=EoM/> Temporary sites are scattered around the home range and are used as refuges, while the main [[burrow]] is also used for breeding. Main burrows can be deep and extensive, have several entrances and can be as long as {{convert|13|m|ft}}.<ref name=EoM/> These burrows can be large enough for a man to enter.<ref name=Colliers/> The aardvark changes the layout of its home burrow regularly, and periodically moves on and makes a new one. The old burrows are an important part of the African wildlife scene. As they are vacated, then they are inhabited by smaller animals like the [[African Wild Dog|African wild dog]], [[ant-eating chat]], ''[[Nycteris thebaica]]'' and [[warthog]]s.<ref name=UR4/> Other animals that use them are hares, mongooses, hyenas, owls, pythons, and lizards. Without these refuges many animals would die during wildfire season.<ref name=UR4/> Only mothers and young share burrows; however, the aardvark is known to live in small family groups or as a solitary creature.<ref name=Colliers/> If attacked in the tunnel, it will escape by digging out of the tunnel thereby placing the fresh fill between it and its predator, or if it decides to fight it will roll onto its back, and attack with its claws.<ref name=Colliers/> The aardvark has been known to sleep in a recently excavated [[ant]] nest, which also serves as protection from its [[predator]]s.<ref>{{harvnb|Anon|2013a}}</ref>\n\n===Reproduction===\n[[File:Aardvarks.jpg|thumb|right|Aardvark mother and young]]\nAardvarks pair only during the breeding season; after a [[gestation]] period of seven months,<ref name=EoM/> one cub weighing around {{convert|1.7|-|1.9|kg|lb}}<ref name=UR/> is born during May\u2013July.<ref name=Colliers/> When born, the young has flaccid ears and many wrinkles.

They are not considered common anywhere in Africa, but due to their large range, they maintain sufficient numbers. There may be a slight decrease in numbers in eastern, northern, and western Africa. Southern African numbers are not decreasing. It receives an official designation from the IUCN as [[least concern]].<ref name=\"iucn\"/> However, they are a species in a precarious situation, as they are so dependent on such specific food; therefore if a problem arises with the abundance of termites, the species as a whole would be affected drastically.<ref name=EoM/>\n\nAardvarks handle captivity well. The first zoo to have one was [[London Zoo]] in 1869, which had an animal from [[South Africa]].<ref name=UR6/>\n\n==Mythology and popular culture==\n[[File:F-14A Tomcat of VF-114 in flight 1977.jpg|thumb|200px|F-14 Tomcat from VF-114 Aardvarks with the squadron mascot painted on the tail]]\n\nIn [[African folklore]], the aardvark is much admired because of its diligent quest for food and its fearless response to [[army ant|soldier ants]]. [[Hausa people|Hausa]] magicians make a charm from the heart, skin, forehead, and nails of the aardvark, which they then proceed to pound together with the root of a certain tree. Wrapped in a piece of skin and worn on the chest, the charm is said to give the owner the ability to pass through walls or roofs at night. The charm is said to be used by burglars and those seeking to visit young girls without their parents' permission.<ref>{{harvnb|Rebecca|2007}}</ref> Also, some tribes, such as the [[Mangbetu people|Margbetu]], [[Ayanda]], and [[Logo people|Logo]],<ref name=EoM/> will use aardvark teeth to make bracelets, which are regarded as good luck charms.<ref name=Colliers/> The meat, which has a resemblance to pork, is eaten in certain cultures.<ref name=EoM/>\n\nThe [[Egyptian mythology|Egyptian god]] [[Set (mythology)|Set]] is usually depicted with the head of an [[Set animal|unidentified animal]], whose similarity to an aardvark has been noted in scholarship.<ref>{{harvnb|te Velde|1997|p=13}}</ref>\n\nThe titular character of ''[[Arthur (TV series)|Arthur]]'', an animated television series for children based on a book series and produced by [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]], shown in more than 180 countries, is an aardvark.<ref>{{harvnb|WGBH|2013}}</ref>\n\nAn aardvark features as the antagonist in the cartoon ''[[The Ant and the Aardvark]]'' as well as in the Canadian animated series ''[[The Raccoons]]''.\n\nIn the military, the Air Force supersonic fighter-bomber [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111/FB-111]] was nicknamed the Aardvark because of its long nose resembling the animal.  It also had similarities with its nocturnal missions flown at a very low level employing ordnance that could penetrate deep into the ground.  In the US Navy, the squadron [[VF-114]] was nicknamed the Aardvarks, flying [[McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II|F-4]]s and then [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14]]s.  The squadron mascot was adapted from the animal in the comic strip ''[[B.C.

Termites of this family depend on dead and withered grass and are most populous in heavily grazed [[grassland]]s and [[savannah]]s, including [[arable land|farmland]]. For most of the year, aardwolves spend time in shared territories consisting of up to a dozen dens, which are occupied for six weeks at a time.<ref name=\"wff\" />\n\nThere are two distinct populations: one in Southern Africa, and another in East and Northeast Africa.

At this rate, an individual may mark 60 marks per hour,<ref name=PKR/> and upwards of 200 per night.<ref name=mh108/>\n\nAn aardwolf pair may have up to 10 dens, and numerous [[midden]]s, within their territory. When they deposit feces at their middens, they dig a small hole and then cover it with sand. Their dens are usually abandoned [[aardvark]], [[springhare]], or [[Old World porcupine|porcupine]] dens,<ref name=br31>{{harvnb|Brottman|2012|p=31}}</ref> or on occasion they are crevices in rocks. They will also dig their own dens, or enlarge dens started by springhares.<ref name=PKR/> They typically will only use one or two dens at a time, rotating through all of their dens every six months. During the summer, they may rest outside their den during the night, and sleep underground during the heat of the day.\n\nAardwolves are not fast runners nor are they particularly adept at fighting off predators. Therefore, when threatened, the aardwolf may attempt to mislead its foe by doubling back on its tracks. If confronted, it may raise its mane in an attempt to appear more menacing. It also emits a foul-smelling liquid from its anal glands.<ref name=Colliers/>\n\n===Feeding===\nThe aardwolf feeds primarily on termites and more specifically on ''[[Trinervitermes]]''.<ref name=mh71>{{harvnb|Mills|Harvey|2001|p=71}}</ref> This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat ''T. bettonianus'', and in central Africa, they eat ''T. rhodesiensis'', and finally in southern Africa, they eat ''[[Trinervitermes trinervoides|T. trinervoides]]''.<ref name=EB/><ref name=mh71/><ref name=PKR>{{harvnb|Richardson|Bearder|1984|pp=158\u2013159}}</ref> Their technique consists of licking them off the ground as opposed to the [[aardvark]], which digs into the mound.<ref name=br30/> They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites.<ref name=PKR/> An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 [[termites]] per night using its sticky, long tongue.<ref name=mh71/><ref name=\"wff\" /> They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months.<ref name=br31/> During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out ''[[Hodotermes]] mossambicus'', a type of [[harvester termite]]<ref name=PKR/> active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter.<ref name=mh71/> The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera ''[[Odontotermes]]'' and ''[[Macrotermes]]''.<ref name=mh71/> They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute a very small percentage of their total diet.<ref name=PKR/> Unlike other [[hyena]]s, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals.<ref name=w1/><ref name=br31/> Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while hunched over a dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles.<ref name=w1/> Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them.<ref name=w1/> The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups,<ref name=Colliers/> but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers,<ref name=koel/> necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, ''Trinervitermes'', forages in small but dense patches of {{convert|25|-|100|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=PKR/> While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} per hour, which translates to {{convert|8|-|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} per summer night and {{convert|3|-|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} per winter night.<ref name=w1/>\n\n===Breeding===\nThe [[breeding season]] varies depending on location, but normally takes place during autumn or spring. In South Africa, breeding occurs in early July.<ref name=mh108/> During the breeding season, unpaired male aardwolves search their own territory, as well as others, for a female to mate with. Dominant males also mate opportunistically with the females of less dominant neighboring aardwolves,<ref name=mh108/> which can result in conflict between rival males.<ref name=ingo/> Dominant males even go a step further and as the breeding season approaches, they make increasingly greater and greater incursions onto weaker males' territories. As the female comes into [[oestrus]], they add pasting to their tricks inside of the other territories, sometimes doing so more in rivals' territories than their own.<ref name=mh108/> Females will also, when given the opportunity, mate with the dominant male, which increases the chances of the dominant male guarding \"his\" cubs with her.<ref name=mh108/> [[Copulation (zoology)|Copulation]] lasts between 1 and 4.5 hours.<ref>Sliwa, Alexander. \"[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Alexander_Sliwa/publication/35640520_A_functional_analysis_of_scent_marking_and_mating_behaviour_in_the_aardwolf_Proteles_cristatus_Sparrman_1783/links/54edc8cd0cf272fc6d224e72.pdf A functional analysis of scent marking and mating behaviour in the aardwolf.]\" Proteles cristatus (1996).</ref> [[Gestation]] lasts between 89 and 92 days,<ref name=ingo/><ref name=mh108/> producing two to five [[List of animal names|cubs]] (most often two or three) during the rainy season (November\u2013December),<ref name=Colliers/> when termites are more active.<ref name=EB/> They are born with their eyes open, but initially are helpless,<ref name=PKR/> and weigh around {{convert|200|-|350|g|oz|abbr=on}}.<ref name=ingo/> The first six to eight weeks are spent in the [[Burrow|den]] with their parents.<ref name=br31/> The male may spend up to six hours a night watching over the cubs while the mother is out looking for food.<ref name=mh108/><ref name=PKR/> After three months, they begin supervised foraging, and by four months are normally independent, though they often share a den with their mother until the next breeding season.<ref name=br31/> By the time the next set of cubs is born, the older cubs have moved on.<ref name=mh108/> Aardwolves generally achieve [[sexual maturity]] at one and a half to two years of age.<ref name=ingo/>\n\n==Conservation==\nThe aardwolf has not seen decreasing numbers and they are relatively widespread throughout eastern Africa. They are not common throughout their range, as they maintain a density of no more than 1 per square kilometer, if the food is good. Because of these factors, the IUCN has rated the aardwolf as [[least concern]].<ref name=\"IUCN\"/> In some areas, they are persecuted by man because of the mistaken belief that they prey on livestock; however, they are actually beneficial to the farmers because they eat termites that are detrimental.<ref name=PKR/> In other areas, the farmers have recognized this, but they are still killed, on occasion, for their fur. Dogs and insecticides<ref name=\"IUCN\"/> are also common killers of the aardwolf.<ref name=br31/>\n\n==Interaction with humans==\nAardwolfs are common sights at zoos.

Adobe is among the earliest building materials, and is used throughout the world.\n\n==Description==\n\nAdobe bricks are most often made into units weighing less than 100 pounds and small enough that they can quickly air dry individually without cracking and be subsequently assembled, with the application of adobe mud, to bond the individual bricks into a structure. Modern methods of construction allow the pouring of whole adobe walls that are reinforced with steel.\n\n==Strength==\n\nIn dry climates, adobe structures are extremely durable, and account for some of the oldest existing buildings in the world.

The [[soil]] composition typically contains [[sand]], [[silt]] and [[clay]]. Straw is useful in binding the brick together and allowing the brick to dry evenly, thereby preventing cracking due to uneven shrinkage rates through the brick.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Vargas|first=J.|author2=J.

The most desirable soil texture for producing the mud of adobe is 15% clay, 10\u201330% silt and 55\u201375% fine sand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=James|title=Adobe-The Material, Its Deterioration, Its Coatings|url=http://missions.arizona.edu/sites/default/files/1%20Garrison-Adobe%20Characteristics.pdf|accessdate=27 February 2013|pages=5\u201316}}</ref> Another source quotes 15\u201325% clay and the remainder sand and coarser particles up to cobbles {{convert|2|to|10|in|mm|order=flip|-1|abbr=on}} with no deleterious effect. Modern adobe is stabilized with either emulsified asphalt or Portland [[cement]] up to 10% by weight.\n\nNo more than half the clay content should be [[expansive clay]]s with the remainder non-expansive illite or kaolinite. Too much expansive clay results in uneven drying through the brick resulting in cracking, while too much kaolinite will make a weak brick. Typically the soils of the Southwest United States, where such construction is in use, are an adequate composition.<ref>{{cite web|last=Austin |first=George |url=http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |work=New Mexico Geology, November 1984 |publisher=New Mexico Bureau of Mines and Mineral Resources |title=Adobe as a building material |deadurl=yes |accessdate=27 February 2013 |page=70 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202232337/http://geoinfo.nmt.edu/publications/periodicals/nmg/downloads/6/n4/nmg_v6_n4_p69.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2013 |df= }}</ref>\n\n==Material properties==\n\n[[File:Djenne great mud mosque.jpg|thumb|The [[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]], [[Mali]] is built in adobe. The struts projecting from the wall serve as decoration, as well as supports for scaffolding during maintenance]]\nAdobe walls are load bearing, i.e. they carry their own weight into the foundation rather than by another structure, hence the adobe must have sufficient compressive strength. In the United States, most building codes<ref>{{cite web|url=http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |title=14.7.4 NMAC |format=PDF |accessdate=25 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130818200926/http://quentinwilson.squarespace.com/storage/adobecode.pdf |archivedate=18 August 2013 |df= }}</ref> call for a minimum compressive strength of 300&nbsp;lbf/in<sup>2</sup> (2.07&nbsp;newton/mm<sup>2</sup>) for the adobe block. Adobe construction should be designed so as to avoid lateral structural loads that would cause bending loads. The building codes require the building sustain a 1 g lateral acceleration earthquake load. Such an acceleration will cause lateral loads on the walls, resulting in shear and bending and inducing tensile stresses. To withstand such loads, the codes typically call for a tensile modulus of rupture strength of at least 50&nbsp;lbf/in<sup>2</sup> (0.345&nbsp;newton/mm<sup>2</sup>) for the finished block.\n\nIn addition to being an inexpensive material with a small resource cost, adobe can serve as a significant heat reservoir due to the thermal properties inherent in the massive walls typical in adobe construction. In climates typified by hot days and cool nights, the high thermal mass of adobe mediates the high and low temperatures of the day, moderating the living space temperature. The massive walls require a large and relatively long input of heat from the sun ([[radiation]]) and from the surrounding air ([[convection]]) before they warm through to the interior. After the sun sets and the temperature drops, the warm wall will then continue to transfer heat to the interior for several hours due to the time-lag effect. Thus, a well-planned adobe wall of the appropriate thickness is very effective at controlling inside temperature through the wide daily fluctuations typical of desert climates, a factor which has contributed to its longevity as a building material.\n\nThermodynamic material properties are sparsely quoted. The thermal resistance of adobe is quoted as having an [[R-value (insulation)|R-value]] of R<sub>0</sub> = 0.41 h ft<sup>2</sup> \u00b0F/([[Btu]] in)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/ECMD/FORMS/documents/MANUAL2.1.pdf |title=2009 New Mexico Energy Conservation Code: Residential Applications Manual |publisher=Emnrd.state.nm.us |accessdate=21 July 2013}}</ref> and a conductivity of 0.57 W/(m K) quoted from another source.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ch\u00e1vez-Gal\u00e1n|first1=Jesus|last2=Almanza|first2=Rafael|last3=Rodr\u00edguez|first3=Neftali|title=Experimental Measurements of Thermal Properties for Mexican Building Materials to Simulate Thermal Behavior to Save Energy|url=http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-540-75997-3_89|publisher=Spriner|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref> A third source provides the following properties: conductivity=0.30 Btu/(h ft \u00b0F); heat capacity=0.24 Btu/(lb \u00b0F); density=106 lb/ft<sup>3</sup> (1700&nbsp;kg/m<sup>3</sup>).<ref>{{cite web|title=HVAC Systems AE-390|url=http://www.pages.drexel.edu/~act27/AE390/A5/index_files/Page536.htm|publisher=Drexel University|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>  To determine the total R-value of a wall for example, multiply R<sub>0</sub> by the thickness of the wall.

Puddle is a general term for a clay or clay and sand based material worked into a dense, plastic state.<ref>\"puddle, n. 4.\". ''Oxford English Dictionary'' 2nd. ed. 2009. CD-rom.</ref> These are the oldest methods of building with adobe in the Americas until holes in the ground were used as forms and then later wooden forms used to make individual bricks were introduced by the Spanish.<ref name=\"Keefe\">Keefe, Laurence. ''Earth Building: Methods and Materials, Repair and Conservation''. London: Taylor & Francis, 2005. 22. Print.</ref>\n\n===Adobe bricks===\n\n[[File:Milyanfan-adobe-bricks-8038.jpg|thumb|Adobe bricks near a construction site in [[Milyanfan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]]]]\nBricks made from adobe are usually made by pressing the mud mixture into an open timber frame. In North America, the brick is typically about {{convert|25|by|36|cm|0|abbr=on}} in size. The mixture is molded into the frame, which is then is removed after initial setting. After drying for a few hours, the bricks are turned on edge to finish drying. Slow drying in shade reduces cracking.\n\nThe same mixture, without straw, is used to make [[Mortar (masonry)|mortar]] and often [[plaster]] on interior and exterior walls. Some ancient cultures used [[Lime (material)|lime]]-based cement for the plaster to protect against rain damage.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDepending on the form into which the mixture is pressed, adobe can encompass nearly any shape or size, provided drying is even and the mixture includes reinforcement for larger bricks. Reinforcement can include manure, straw, [[cement]], [[rebar]] or wooden posts. Experience has shown straw, cement, or manure added to a standard adobe mixture can all produce a stronger, more crack-resistant brick.<ref>{{cite web|author=Technical Information Online |url=http://practicalaction.org/docs/technical_information_service/mud_plasters_and_renders.pdf |title=Mud Plasters and Renders \u2013 Technical Information Online \u2013 Practical Answers |publisher=Practicalaction.org |accessdate=9 November 2010}}</ref> A test is done on the soil content first. To do so, a sample of the soil is mixed into a clear container with some water, creating an almost completely saturated liquid. The container is shaken vigorously for one minute. It is then allowed to settle for a day until the soil has settled into layers. Heavier particles settle out first, sand above, silt above that and very fine clay and organic matter will stay in suspension for days. After the water has cleared, percentages of the various particles can be determined. Fifty to 60 percent sand and 35 to 40 percent clay will yield strong bricks. The [[Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service]] at [[New Mexico State University]] recommends a mix of not more than 1/3 clay, not less than 1/2 sand, and never more than 1/3 silt.\n\n===Adobe wall construction===\n[[File:Fort Saint-S\u00e9bastien - Visite des fouilles juin 2012 68.jpg|thumb|The [[earthen plaster]] removed exposing the adobe bricks at Fort St. Sebastian in France]]\nThe ground supporting an adobe structure should be compressed, as the weight of adobe wall is significant and foundation settling may cause cracking of the wall. Footing depth is to below the ground frost level. The footing and stem wall are commonly 24 and 14 inches thick, respectively.  Modern construction codes call for the use of reinforcing steel in the footing and stem wall. Adobe bricks are laid by course. Adobe walls usually never rise above two stories as they are load bearing and adobe has low structural strength. When creating window and door openings, a [[lintel]] is placed on top of the opening to support the bricks above. Atop the last courses of brick, bond beams made of heavy wood beams or modern reinforced concrete are laid to provide a horizontal bearing plate for the roof beams and to redistribute lateral earthquake loads to shear walls more able to carry the forces. To protect the interior and exterior adobe walls, finishes such as mud plaster, whitewash or stucco can be applied. These protect the adobe wall from water damage, but need to be reapplied periodically. Alternatively, the walls can be finished with other nontraditional plasters that provide longer protection. Bricks made with stabilized adobe generally do not need protection of plasters.\n\n===Adobe roof===\nThe traditional adobe roof has been constructed using a mixture of soil/clay, water, sand and organic materials. The mixture was then formed and pressed into wood forms, producing rows of dried earth bricks that would then be laid across a support structure of wood and plastered into place with more adobe.\n\nDepending on the materials available, a roof may be assembled using wood or metal beams to create a framework to begin layering adobe bricks. Depending on the thickness of the adobe bricks, the framework has been preformed using a steel framing and a layering of a metal fencing or wiring over the framework to allow an even load as masses of adobe are spread across the metal fencing like cob and allowed to air dry accordingly. This method was demonstrated with an adobe blend heavily impregnated with cement to allow even drying and prevent cracking.\n\nThe more traditional flat adobe roofs are functional only in dry climates that are not exposed to snow loads. The heaviest wooden beams, called [[Viga (architecture)|vigas]], lie atop the wall. Across the vigas lie smaller members called latillas<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dl-building.com/preservation-historic-adobe-buildings/ |title=Preservation of Historic Adobe Buildings |publisher=Dawson Lupul |accessdate=30 January 2014}}</ref> and upon those brush is then laid. Finally, the adobe layer is applied.\n\nTo construct a flat adobe roof, beams of wood were laid to span the building, the ends of which were attached to the tops of the walls. Once the vigas, latillas and brush are laid, adobe bricks are placed. An adobe roof is often laid with bricks slightly larger in width to ensure a greater expanse is covered when placing the bricks onto the roof. Following each individual brick should be a layer of adobe mortar, recommended to be at least {{convert|1|in|mm|order=flip|abbr=on}} thick to make certain there is ample strength between the brick\u2019s edges and also to provide a relative moisture barrier during rain. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}\n\nDepending on the materials, adobe roofs can be inherently fire-proof. The construction of a chimney can greatly influence the construction of the roof supports, creating an extra need for care in choosing the materials. The builders can make an adobe chimney by stacking simple adobe bricks in a similar fashion as the surrounding walls\n\n==Adobe around the world==\nThe largest structure ever made from adobe is the [[Arg-\u00e9 Bam]] built by the [[Achaemenid Empire]]. Other large adobe structures are the [[Huaca del Sol]] in [[Peru]], with 100 million signed bricks and the ''ciudellas'' of [[Chan Chan]] and [[Tambo Colorado]], both in Peru.\n{{wide image|Ancient Bam, 2002.png|1000px|align-cap=center|The [[citadel]] of [[Bam, Iran]], or [[Arg-\u00e9 Bam]], in [[Kerman Province]], [[Iran]]: The world's largest adobe structure, dating to at least 500&nbsp;BC}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"4\">\nImage:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0003jpg.JPG|Still in production today, [[Romania]]'s [[Danube Delta]]\nImage:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0002jpg.JPG|Mixing mud and straw in brick frames\nImage:RomaniaDanubeDelta MakingMaterialForCOnstructing0001jpg.JPG|Community effort\nImage:Milyanfan-adobe-brick-house-8039.jpg|Adobe brick house under construction in [[Kyrgyzstan]]\nImage: Sa'dah 02.jpg|House in [[Sa'dah]], [[Yemen]]\nImage:AdobeHouseVrancea.JPG|Adobe brick house under construction in [[Romania]]\nImage:5640-Linxia-City-Dongguan-back-street.jpg|An adobe wall in [[Linxia City]], [[Gansu]], China\nImage:Poeh museum, night.jpg|[[Poeh Museum]] tower, the tallest adobe structure in [[New Mexico]], USA\nImage:16 21 2688 san miguel.jpg|[[San Miguel Mission]] in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]]\nImage:Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9 3.jpg|[[Great Mosque of Djenn\u00e9]], famous building made from [[Mudbrick#Banco|banco]], a type of adobe\nImage:Adobe house in middle america.jpg|Adobe house in [[Middle America (United States)|Middle America]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alker]]\n* [[Cob (building)]]\n* [[Compressed earth block]]\n* [[Earth structure]]\n* [[Hassan Fathy]]\n* [[Mudbrick]]\n* [[Qadad]] (waterproofing plaster)\n* [[Qalat (fortress)]]\n* [[Rammed earth]]\n* [[San Xavier del Bac]]\n* [[Sod house]]\n* [[Super Adobe]]\n* [[Wattle and daub]]\n* [[Cas di torto]]\n* [[Monterey Colonial architecture]] used adobe walls\n* [[Ctesiphon Arch]] in Iraq is the largest mud brick arch in the world built beginning in 540 AD\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Adobe (building material)}}\n{{Wiktionary|adobe}}\n* [http://www.buildingwithawareness.com/ ''Building With Awareness''] A detailed how-to DVD video that shows adobe wall construction and their use as thermal mass walls\n* [http://www.calearth.org Cal-Earth (The California Institute of Earth Art and Architecture)] has developed a patented system called Superadobe, in which bags filled with stabilized earth are layered with strands of barbed wire to form a structure strong enough to withstand earthquakes, fire and flood.\n* [http://www.eartharchitecture.org Earth Architecture] \u2013 A website whose focus is contemporary issues in earth architecture.\n* [http://www.eartha.org.uk/ Earth Architecture and Conservation in East Anglia] \u2013 British organisation that focuses on the proper maintenance and conservation of earth buildings in a region of the UK that has a long history of building with mud.\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20060525191123/http://kerpic.org/ Kerpic.org] \u2013 A website on earthen architecture researches stabilized with gypsum.\n* [http://www.kleiwerks.org Kleiwerks] \u2013 International organization recognized for their unique contribution to modern earthen and natural building techniques throughout the world, their focus is on education through hands on experience.

It may also be a bold, usually [[risk]]y undertaking, with an uncertain outcome.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref> Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]]. The term also broadly refers to any enterprise that is potentially fraught with physical, financial or psychological risk, such as a business venture, or other major life undertakings.\n\nThe word '''adventuress''' can mean a female who enjoys or partakes in adventures, but (particularly in older literature) it can also have the negative connotation of one who schemes for material advancement by the use her sexuality; a [[gold digging|gold digger]]<ref>''Oxford English Dictionary'', \"adventuress\"; ''Merriam-Webster Dictionary'', \"adventuress\".</ref>  As an instance of the latter the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' cites \"Our Adventuress had the pickings of a few Feathers from an old Gentleman who fell in Love with her\".\n\n==Motivation==\nAdventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],<ref>{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gom\u00e0-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}</ref> which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[Andr\u00e9 Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), \"If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?\".{{full|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that \"Life is either a daring adventure or nothing.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}</ref>\n\nOutdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers \u2013 the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].\n\n==Adventure in mythology and fiction==\nSome of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise \u2013 (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}</ref><ref>Zweig, P.

Examples include books such as [[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]] or [[My Side of the Mountain]]. These books are less about \"questing\", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.\n===Questing===\nMany adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the \"call to adventure\", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.\n===Video games===\nMany [[video games]] are adventure games.\n\n==Adventure in nonfiction==\nFrom ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals.

The major geographical theorist of the empire was actually a former Swedish prisoner-of-war, taken at the [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709 and assigned to [[Tobolsk]], where he associated with Peter's Siberian official, [[Vasily Tatishchev]], and was allowed freedom to conduct geographical and anthropological studies in preparation for a future book.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Sweden, five years after Peter's death, in 1730 [[Philip Johan von Strahlenberg]] published a new atlas proposing the Urals as the border of Asia. The Russians were enthusiastic about the concept, which allowed them to keep their European identity in geography. Tatishchev announced that he had proposed the idea to von Strahlenberg. The latter had suggested the [[Emba River]] as the lower boundary. Over the next century various proposals were made until the [[Ural River]] prevailed in the mid-19th century. The border had been moved perforce from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea into which the Ural River projects.<ref>{{harvnb|Lewis|Wigen|1997|pp=27\u201328}}</ref> The border between the Black Sea and the Caspian is usually placed along the crest of the [[Caucasus Mountains]], although it is sometimes placed further north.<ref name=\"NatGeo\"/>\n\n===Asia\u2013Oceania boundary===\nThe border between Asia and the region of [[Oceania]] is usually placed somewhere in the [[Malay Archipelago]].

The terms Southeast Asia and Oceania, devised in the 19th century, have had several vastly different geographic meanings since their inception.

Reid|Reid, T.R.]] ''[[Confucius Lives Next Door: What living in the East teaches us about living in the west]]'' Vintage Books(1999).</ref> The place name \"Asia\" in various forms in a large number of modern languages is of unknown ultimate provenience. Its etymology and language of origin are uncertain. It appears to be one of the most ancient of recorded names. A number of theories have been published. English Asia can be traced through the formation of English literature to Latin literature, where it has the same form, Asia. Whether all uses and all forms of the name derive also from the Latin of the [[Roman Empire]] is much less certain. One of the first classical writers to use Asia as a name of the whole continent was [[Pliny the Elder|Pliny]].<ref>http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=Asia&allowed_in_frame=0</ref> This [[metonymy|metonymical]] change in meaning is common and can be observed in some other geographical names, such as [[Skandinavia]] (from [[Scania]]).\n\n===Bronze Age===\nBefore Greek poetry, the [[Aegean Sea]] area was in a [[Greek Dark Age]], at the beginning of which syllabic writing was lost and alphabetic writing had not begun. Prior to then in the [[Bronze Age]] the records of the [[Assyrian Empire]], the [[Hittite Empire]] and the various [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] states of Greece mention a region undoubtedly Asia, certainly in Anatolia, including if not identical to Lydia. These records are administrative and do not include poetry.\n\nThe Mycenaean states were destroyed about 1200&nbsp;BCE by unknown agents although one school of thought assigns the [[Dorian invasion]] to this time. The burning of the palaces baked clay diurnal administrative records written in a Greek syllabic script called [[Linear B]], deciphered by a number of interested parties, most notably by a young World War II cryptographer, [[Michael Ventris]], subsequently assisted by the scholar, [[John Chadwick]]. A major cache discovered by [[Carl Blegen]] at the site of ancient [[Pylos]] included hundreds of male and female names formed by different methods.\n\nSome of these are of women held in servitude (as study of the society implied by the content reveals). They were used in trades, such as cloth-making, and usually came with children. The epithet, lawiaiai, \"captives,\" associated with some of them identifies their origin. Some are ethnic names. One in particular, aswiai, identifies \"women of Asia.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=536}}.</ref> Perhaps they were captured in Asia, but some others, Milatiai, appear to have been of [[Miletus]], a Greek colony, which would not have been raided for slaves by Greeks. Chadwick suggests that the names record the locations where these foreign women were purchased.<ref>{{harvnb|Ventris|Chadwick|1973|p=410}}</ref> The name is also in the singular, Aswia, which refers both to the name of a country and to a female of it. There is a masculine form, aswios. This Aswia appears to have been a remnant of a region known to the Hittites as Assuwa, centered on Lydia, or \"Roman Asia.\" This name, ''Assuwa'', has been suggested as the origin for the name of the continent \"Asia\".<ref>Bossert, Helmut T., ''Asia'', Istanbul, 1946.</ref> The [[Assuwa league]] was a confederation of states in western Anatolia, defeated by the [[Hittites]] under [[Tudhaliya I]] around 1400&nbsp;BCE.\n\nAlternatively, the [[etymology]] of the term may be from the [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] word ''(w)a\u1e63\u00fb(m)'', which means 'to go outside' or 'to ascend', referring to the direction of the sun at sunrise in the Middle East and also likely connected with the Phoenician word ''asa'' meaning east. This may be contrasted to a similar etymology proposed for ''Europe'', as being from Akkadian ''er\u0113bu(m)'' 'to enter' or 'set' (of the sun).\n\n[[T.R. Reid]] supports this alternative etymology, noting that the ancient Greek name must have derived from ''asu'', meaning 'east' in [[Assyria]]n (''ereb'' for ''Europe'' meaning 'west').<ref name=\"reid\"/> The ideas of ''Occidental'' (form [[Latin]] ''Occidens'' 'setting') and ''Oriental'' (from Latin ''Oriens'' for 'rising') are also European invention, synonymous with ''Western'' and ''Eastern''.<ref name=\"reid\"/> Reid further emphasizes that it explains the Western point of view of placing all the peoples and cultures of Asia into a single classification, almost as if there were a need for setting the distinction between Western and [[Eastern world|Eastern civilizations]] on the [[Eurasia]]n continent.<ref name=\"reid\"/> Ogura Kazuo and Tenshin Okakura are two outspoken Japanese figures on the subject.<ref name=\"reid\"/>\n\n===Classical antiquity===\n[[File:Roman Empire - Asia (125 AD).svg|thumb|The province of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] highlighted (in red) within the Roman Empire.]]\nLatin Asia and Greek \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 appear to be the same word. Roman authors translated \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1 as Asia. The Romans named a province [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]], which roughly corresponds with modern-day central-western Turkey. There was an Asia Minor and an Asia Major located in modern-day [[Iraq]]. As the earliest evidence of the name is Greek, it is likely circumstantially that Asia came from \u1f08\u03c3\u03af\u03b1, but ancient transitions, due to the lack of literary contexts, are difficult to catch in the act. The most likely vehicles were the ancient geographers and historians, such as [[Herodotus]], who were all Greek.

By it he means [[Anatolia]] and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], in contrast to [[Greece]] and [[Egypt]].

The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], the [[Indus Valley]] and the [[Yellow River]] shared many similarities. These civilizations may well have exchanged technologies and ideas such as [[mathematics]] and the wheel. Other innovations, such as writing, seem to have been developed individually in each area. Cities, states and empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe central steppe region had long been inhabited by horse-mounted nomads who could reach all areas of Asia from the [[steppe]]s. The earliest postulated expansion out of the steppe is that of the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]], who spread their languages into the Middle East, South Asia, and the borders of [[China]], where the [[Tocharians]] resided. The northernmost part of Asia, including much of [[Siberia]], was largely inaccessible to the steppe nomads, owing to the dense forests, climate and [[tundra]]. These areas remained very sparsely populated.\n\n[[File:Silkroutes.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Silk Road]] connected many civilizations across Asia<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silk-road.com/artl/srtravelmain.shtml|title=ANCIENT SILK ROAD TRAVELLERS|author=Silkroad Foundation, Adela C.Y.

The [[Caucasus]] and [[Himalaya]] mountains and the [[Karakum Desert|Karakum]] and [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] deserts formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could cross only with difficulty. While the urban city dwellers were more advanced technologically and socially, in many cases they could do little in a military aspect to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe. However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force; for this and other reasons, the [[nomad]]s who conquered states in China, India, and the Middle East often found themselves adapting to the local, more affluent societies.\n\nThe Islamic [[Caliphate]] took over the Middle East and Central Asia during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century. The [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Before the Mongol invasion, [[Song dynasty]] reportedly had approximately 120 million citizens; the 1300 census which followed the invasion reported roughly 60 million people.<ref>Ping-ti Ho. \"An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China\", in ''\u00c9tudes Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970). pp. 33\u201353.</ref>\n\nThe [[Black Death]], one of the most devastating [[pandemic]]s in human history, is thought to have originated in the arid plains of central Asia, where it then travelled along the [[Silk Road]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/blackdisease_01.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 History \u2013 Black Death |publisher=BBC |date=17 February 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of Siberia and most of [[Central Asia]] by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, most of the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the mid 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. The Islamic [[Mughal Empire]] and the Hindu [[Maratha Empire]] controlled much of India in the 16th and 18th centuries respectively.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Sen|first1=Sailendra Nath|title=An Advanced History of Modern India|page=11|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=bXWiACEwPR8C&pg=PA1941-IA82&lpg=PA1941-IA82&dq=Peshwa+Balaji+Vishwanath+1714&source=bl&ots=kqD8F1YxL1&sig=OoCIPl_SH4oqKws730skPFJxVqc&hl=en&sa=X&ei=fluCVcjhFsT98QWFg4L4Dw&ved=0CDYQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref>\n\n==Geography and climate==\n{{main article|Geography of Asia|Climate of Asia}}\n{{see also|:Category:Biota of Asia}}\n[[File:Himalayas.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range is home to some of the planet's highest peaks.]]\nAsia is the largest [[continent]] on Earth. It covers 8.8% of the Earth's total surface area (or 30% of its land area), and has the largest coastline, at {{convert|62800|km|mi|0}}. Asia is generally defined as comprising the eastern four-fifths of [[Eurasia]]. It is located to the east of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Ural Mountains]], and south of the [[Caucasus Mountains]] (or the [[Kuma\u2013Manych Depression]]) and the [[Caspian Sea|Caspian]] and [[Black Sea]]s.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite encyclopedia| title=Asia | url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110518/Asia | encyclopedia=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]] Online | year=2006 | location=Chicago | publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Inc}}</ref> It is bounded on the east by the [[Pacific Ocean]], on the south by the [[Indian Ocean]] and on the north by the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Asia is subdivided into 48 countries, three of them ([[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Turkey]]) having part of their land in Europe.\n\nAsia has extremely diverse climates and geographic features. Climates range from arctic and subarctic in Siberia to tropical in southern India and Southeast Asia. It is moist across southeast sections, and dry across much of the interior. Some of the largest daily temperature ranges on Earth occur in western sections of Asia. The monsoon circulation dominates across southern and eastern sections, due to the presence of the Himalayas forcing the formation of a thermal low which draws in moisture during the summer. Southwestern sections of the continent are hot. Siberia is one of the coldest places in the Northern Hemisphere, and can act as a source of arctic air masses for North America. The most active place on Earth for tropical cyclone activity lies northeast of the Philippines and south of Japan. The [[Gobi Desert]] is in [[Mongolia]] and the [[Arabian Desert]] stretches across much of the Middle East. The [[Yangtze River]] in China is the longest river in the continent. The [[Himalayas]] between Nepal and China is the tallest mountain range in the world. Tropical rainforests stretch across much of southern Asia and coniferous and deciduous forests lie farther north.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Paysan soignant ses boeufs (Kerala).jpg|[[Kerala backwaters]]\nFile:Naadam rider 2.jpg|Mongolian [[steppe]]\nFile:1 li jiang guilin yangshuo 2011.jpg|[[South China Karst]]\nFile:Akkem Valley 2011.jpg|[[Altai Mountains]]\nFile:Hunza Valley from Eagle Point.jpg|[[Hunza Valley]]\n</gallery>\n\n===Climate change===\n\nA survey carried out in 2010 by global risk analysis farm [[Maplecroft]] identified 16 countries that are extremely vulnerable to climate change. Each nation's vulnerability was calculated using 42 socio, economic and environmental indicators, which identified the likely climate change impacts during the next 30 years. The Asian countries of [[Bangladesh]], [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[Thailand]], [[Pakistan]] and [[Sri Lanka]] were among the 16 countries facing extreme risk from climate change. Some shifts are already occurring. For example, in tropical parts of India with a [[semi-arid climate]], the temperature increased by 0.4&nbsp;\u00b0C between 1901 and 2003.\nA 2013 study by the [[International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics]] ([[ICRISAT]]) aimed to find science-based, pro-poor approaches and techniques that would enable Asia's agricultural systems to cope with climate change, while benefitting poor and vulnerable farmers. The study's recommendations ranged from improving the use of climate information in local planning and strengthening weather-based agro-advisory services, to stimulating diversification of rural household incomes and providing incentives to farmers to adopt natural resource conservation measures to enhance forest cover, replenish groundwater and use [[renewable energy]].<ref>[http://exploreit.icrisat.org/sites/default/files/uploads/1378286859_PolicyBrief23.pdf ''Vulnerability to Climate Change: Adaptation Strategies and layers of Resilience''], [[ICRISAT]], Policy Brief No. 23, February 2013</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main article|Economy of Asia}}\n[[File:1 singapore city skyline dusk panorama 2011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Singapore]] has one of the [[World's busiest port|busiest ports in the world]] and is the world's fourth largest [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] trading center.]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"text-align: right; float:right; clear:right; border:1px solid #aaa; margin:10px\"\n|- style=\"background:#dbdbdb;\"\n!

Collectively, Aruba and the other Dutch islands in the Caribbean are often called the [[Dutch Caribbean]].\n\nAruba is one of the four countries that form the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], along with the [[Netherlands]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and [[Sint Maarten]]; the citizens of these countries are all Dutch nationals. Aruba has no administrative subdivisions, but, for census purposes, is divided into eight regions. Its capital is [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]].\n\nUnlike much of the Caribbean region, Aruba has a dry climate and an arid, [[cactus]]-strewn landscape. This climate has helped tourism as visitors to the island can reliably expect warm, sunny weather.

Fragments of the earliest known Indian settlements date back to 1000 AD. As sea currents made [[canoe]] travel to other [[Caribbean islands]] difficult, [[Caquetio]] culture remained more closely associated with that of mainland South America.\n\nEuropeans first learned of Aruba following the explorations for Spain by [[Amerigo Vespucci]] and [[Alonso de Ojeda]] in the summer of 1499. Both described Aruba as an \"island of giants\", remarking on the comparatively large stature of the native Caquet\u00edos compared to Europeans. Gold was not discovered on Aruba for another 300 years. Vespucci returned to Spain with stocks of cotton and [[Caesalpinia echinata|brazilwood]] from the island and described houses built into the ocean. Vespucci and Ojeda's tales spurred interest in Aruba, and Spaniards soon colonized the island.<ref name=advent>{{cite book |last=Sullivan| first=Lynne M.| year=2006| title=Adventure Guide to Aruba, Bonaire & Cura\u00e7ao| publisher=Hunter Publishing, Inc.| location=Edison, NJ| pages=57\u201358| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M8SyFOyvjkQC&lpg=PA58}}</ref><ref name=early>{{cite book | last=Sauer| first=Carl Ortwin| year=1966| title=The Early Spanish Main| publisher=Cambridge University Press| location=Cambridge| page=112| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=plzS7SL_-f0C&lpg=PA112}}</ref>\n\nBecause it had low rainfall, Aruba was not considered profitable for the plantation system and the economics of the [[slave trade]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAruba was colonized by [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] for over a century. ''Simas'', the ''[[Cacique]]'', or [[Tribal chief|chief]], in Aruba, welcomed the first Catholic priests in Aruba, who gave him a wooden cross as a gift. In 1508, the Spanish Crown appointed Alonso de Ojeda as its first Governor of Aruba, as part of ''Nueva Andaluc\u00eda''. Arawaks spoke the \"broken Spanish\" which their ancestors had learned on [[Hispaniola]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n\nAnother governor appointed by Spain was [[Juan Mart\u00ednez de Ampi\u00e9s]]. A ''c\u00e9dula real'' decreed in November 1525 gave Ampi\u00e9s, factor of Espa\u00f1ola, the right to repopulate Aruba. In 1528, Ampi\u00e9s was replaced by a representative of the [[Welser|House of Welser]] of [[Augsburg]].\n\nThe [[Netherlands|Dutch]] statutes have applied to Aruba since 1629.{{clarify|how could The Netherlands govern Aruba without owning it?|date=July 2015}} The Netherlands acquired Aruba in 1636. Since 1636, Aruba has been under [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] administration, initially governed by [[Peter Stuyvesant]], later appointed to [[New Amsterdam]] (New York City). Stuyvesant was on a special mission in Aruba in November and December 1642. The island was included under the [[Dutch West India Company]] (W.I.C.) administration, as \"New Netherland and Cura\u00e7ao\", from 1648 to 1664. In 1667 the Dutch administration appointed an Irishman as \"Commandeur\" in Aruba.\n\nThe Dutch took control 135 years after the Spanish, leaving the Arawaks to farm and graze livestock, and used the island as a source of meat for other Dutch possessions in the Caribbean.{{citation needed|reason=no direct linkage has been supplied to demonstrate that one lead to the other|date=August 2012}}\n\nDuring the Napoleonic wars, the [[British Empire]] took control over the island, between 1799 and 1802, and between 1804 and 1816, before handing it back to the Dutch.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britishempire.co.uk/maproom/aruba.htm|title=British Empire: Caribbean: Aruba|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nDuring World War II with the [[Netherlands in World War II#German occupation|occupation of the Netherlands]] in 1940 the oil facilities in Aruba came under the administration of the [[Dutch government-in-exile]] in London, and [[Attack on Aruba|Aruba continued to supply oil to the British and their allies]].\n\n=== Move towards independence ===\nIn August 1947, Aruba presented its first ''Staatsreglement'' (constitution), for Aruba's ''[[Independence|status aparte]]'' as an autonomous state within the [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]].

C. Yarzagaray, a parliamentary member representing the AVP political party, proposed a [[referendum]] so that the people of Aruba could choose whether they wanted total independence or ''Status Aparte'' as a full autonomous state under the Crown.\n\nCroes worked in Aruba to inform and prepare the people of Aruba for independence. In 1976, he appointed a committee that chose the national flag and anthem, introducing them as symbols of Aruba's sovereignty and independence. He set 1981 as a target date for independence.

At the conference in The Hague in 1981, Aruba's independence was set for the year 1991.\n\nIn March 1983, Aruba reached an official agreement within the Kingdom for its independence, to be developed in a series of steps as the Crown granted increasing autonomy. In August 1985 Aruba drafted a constitution that was unanimously approved. On 1 January 1986, after elections were held for its first parliament, Aruba seceded from the Netherlands Antilles; it officially became a country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Full independence was projected in 1996.\n\nAfter his death in 1986, Croes was proclaimed ''Libertador di Aruba''. At a convention in The Hague in 1990, at the request of Aruba's [[Nelson Oduber|Prime Minister]], the governments of Aruba, the Netherlands, and the Netherlands Antilles postponed indefinitely its transition to full independence. The article scheduling Aruba's complete independence was rescinded in 1995, although the process could be revived after another referendum.\n\n== Geography ==\n{{main article|Geography of Aruba}}\n[[File:Aruba map.png|thumb|A map of Aruba]]\n[[File:Aruba - Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indi\u00eb-Antilles part 1, right.gif|thumb|Map of Aruba from the ''[[Encyclopaedie van Nederlandsch West-Indi\u00eb 1914-1917]].'']]\n[[File:197306 aruba naturalbridge.jpg|thumb|Natural bridge in Aruba (collapsed 2 September 2005)]]\n\nAruba is a generally flat, riverless island in the [[Leeward Antilles]] island arc of the [[Lesser Antilles]] in the southern part of the Caribbean.

Oranjestad, the capital, is located at {{Coord|12|19|N|70|1|W|}}.\n\nTo the east of Aruba are [[Bonaire]] and [[Cura\u00e7ao]], two island territories which once formed the southwest part of the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. This group of islands is sometimes called the [[ABC islands (Lesser Antilles)|ABC islands]]. They are located on the South American [[continental shelf]] and therefore geographically listed as part of South America.\n\nThe [[Aruba Natural Bridge|Natural Bridge]] was a large, naturally formed limestone bridge on the island's north shore. It was a popular tourist destination until its collapse in 2005.\n\n=== Cities and towns ===\n{{main article|List of cities in Aruba}}\nThe island, with a population of just over 100,000 inhabitants, does not have major cities. However, most of the island's population resides in or surrounding the two major city-like districts of Oranjestad (Capital) and San Nicolaas. Furthermore, the island is divided into six districts, which are:\n* [[Noord]]\n* [[Oranjestad, Aruba|Oranjestad]] (33,000 in 2006), divided in two districts\n* [[Paradera]]\n* [[San Nicolaas]], divided in two districts\n* [[Santa Cruz, Aruba|Santa Cruz]]\n* [[Savaneta]]\n\n=== Fauna ===\n{{Expand section|date=January 2015}}\n\nThe island of Aruba, being isolated from the main land of South America, has fostered the evolution of multiple endemic animals. The island provides a habitat for the endemic [[Cnemidophorus arubensis|Aruban Whiptail]] and [[Crotalus durissus unicolor|Aruba Rattlesnake]], as well as endemic subspecies of [[Athene cunicularia|Burrowing Owl]] and [[Eupsittula pertinax|Brown-throated Parakeet]].\n\nThe rattlesnake and the owl are printed on the Aruban [[Aruban Florin|currency]].\n\n=== Flora ===\n[[File:Aruba_Cacti.jpg|thumb|Yatu cactus growing in Aruba]]\n{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}\n\nThe flora of Aruba differs from the typical tropical island vegetation. [[Xeric scrublands]] are common, with various forms of [[cacti]], thorny shrubs and evergreens. The most known plant is the [[Aloe vera]], which has a place on the [[Coat of Arms of Aruba]].\n\n=== Climate ===\n{{main article|Climate of Aruba}}\nIn the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]], Aruba has a [[tropics|tropical]] [[semi-arid climate]].<ref name=extremes /> Mean monthly temperature in Oranjestad varies little from {{convert|26.7|\u00b0C|1}} to {{convert|29.2|C}}, moderated by constant [[trade winds]] from the Atlantic Ocean, which comes from north-east.

Although no full-blooded [[Native American (Americas)|Aboriginals]] remain, the features of the islanders clearly indicate their genetic [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] heritage. Most of the population is descended from Caquetio Indians and Dutch and to a lesser extent of Africans, Spanish, Portuguese, English, French, and Sephardic Jewish ancestors.\n\nRecently, there has been substantial immigration to the island from neighboring American and Caribbean nations, possibly attracted by the higher paid jobs. In 2007, new immigration laws were introduced to help control the growth of the population by restricting [[foreign worker]]s to a maximum of three years residency on the island.\n\nDemographically, Aruba has felt the impact of its proximity to Venezuela. Many of Aruba's families are descended from Venezuelan immigrants. There is a seasonal increase of Venezuelans living in second homes.\n\n=== Language ===\n{{main article|Languages of Aruba}}\n\nThe official languages are [[Dutch language|Dutch]] and&nbsp;\u2013 since 2003&nbsp;\u2013 [[Papiamento]]. Papiamento is the predominant language on Aruba. It is a [[creole language]], spoken on Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and [[Cura\u00e7ao]], that incorporates words from Portuguese, West African languages, Dutch, and Spanish. English is known by many; its usage has grown due to tourism. Other common languages spoken, based on the size of their community, are Portuguese, Chinese, German, Spanish, and French.\n\nIn recent years, the government of Aruba has shown an increased interest in acknowledging the cultural and historical importance of its native language. Although spoken Papiamento is fairly similar among the several Papiamento-speaking islands, there is a big difference in written Papiamento. The orthography differs per island and even per group of people. Some are more oriented towards Portuguese and use the equivalent spelling (e.g. \"y\" instead of \"j\"), where others are more oriented towards Dutch.\n\nThe book ''The Buccaneers of America'', first published in 1678, states through eyewitness account that the natives on Aruba spoke Spanish already. The oldest government official statement written in Papiamento dates from 1803. Around 12.6% of the population today speaks Spanish.<ref name=cia>{{cite web |author=Central Intelligence Agency |authorlink=Central Intelligence Agency |publisher=[[The World Factbook]]|title=Aruba |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html |year=2009|accessdate=6 June 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604234830/https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/aa.html| archivedate= 4 June 2011 | deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nAruba has four newspapers published in Papiamento: ''Diario'', ''Bon Dia'', ''Solo di Pueblo'' and ''Awe Mainta''; and three in English: ''Aruba Daily'', ''Aruba Today'' and ''The News''.

According to the ''Bureau Burgelijke Stand en Bevolkingsregister'' (BBSB), in 2005 there were ninety-two different nationalities living on the island. Dutch influence can still be seen, as in the celebration of \"[[Sinterklaas]]\" on 5 and 6 December and other national holidays like 27 April, when in Aruba and the rest of the Kingdom of the Netherlands the King's birthday or \"Dia di Rey\" ([[Koningsdag]]) is celebrated.\n[[File:Iguanas Aruba.JPG|left|thumb|[[Iguana]]s on a rooftop in Aruba]]\n\nChristmas and [[New Year's Eve]] are celebrated with the typical music and songs for [[Gaita flutes|gaita]]s for Christmas and the Dande{{clarify|date=November 2012}} for New Year, and ''[[Hallaca|ayaca]]'', ''[[ponche crema]]'', ham, and other typical foods and drinks. Millions of florins worth of [[fireworks]] are burnt at midnight on New Year's Eve. On 25 January, [[Betico Croes]]' birthday is celebrated. [[St John's Eve|Dia di San Juan]] is celebrated on 24 June.\n\nBesides Christmas, the religious holy days of the [[Feast of the Ascension]] and [[Good Friday]] are holidays on the island.\n\nThe holiday of [[Carnival|Carnaval]] is also an important one in Aruba, as it is in many Caribbean and Latin American countries, and, like [[Mardi Gras]], that goes on for weeks. Its celebration in Aruba started, around the 1950s, influenced by the inhabitants from Venezuela and the nearby islands (Cura\u00e7ao, St. Vincent, Trinidad, Barbados, St. Maarten and Anguilla) who came to work for the Oil refinery. Over the years the Carnival Celebration has changed and now starts from the beginning of January till the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday with a large parade on the last Sunday of the festivities (Sunday before Ash Wednesday).\n\nTourism from the United States has recently increased the visibility of American culture on the island, with such celebrations as [[Halloween]] and Thanksgiving Day in November.\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n[[File:Aruba Palm Beach.JPG|thumb|Palm Beach]]\n\nAruba's [[Queen Beatrix International Airport]] is located near Oranjestad.

The Port of Playa services all the cruise-ship lines, including [[Royal Caribbean International|Royal Caribbean]], [[Carnival Cruise Lines]], [[Norwegian Cruise Line|NCL]], [[Holland America Line]], [[Disney Cruise Line]] and others. Nearly one million tourists enter this port per year. Aruba Ports Authority, owned and operated by the Aruban government, runs these seaports.\n\nArubus is a government-owned bus company.

version was sent to the states for [[ratification]] on November 15, 1777. The Articles of Confederation [[Coming into force|came into force]] on March 1, 1781, after being ratified by all 13 states. A guiding principle of the Articles was to preserve the [[independence]] and [[sovereignty]] of the [[U.S. state|states]]. The federal government received only those powers which the colonies had recognized as belonging to king and parliament.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\">Morison p. 279</ref>\n\nThe Articles formed a war-time confederation of states, with an extremely limited central government. While unratified, the document was used by the Congress to conduct business, direct the [[American Revolutionary War]], conduct diplomacy with foreign nations, and deal with territorial issues and Native American relations. The adoption of the Articles made few perceptible changes in the federal government, because it did little more than legalize what the Continental Congress had been doing. That body was renamed the Congress of the Confederation; but Americans continued to call it the ''Continental Congress'', since its organization remained the same.<ref name=\"Morison p.279\"/>\n\nAs the Confederation Congress attempted to govern the continually growing American states, delegates discovered that the limitations placed upon the central government rendered it ineffective at doing so. As the government's weaknesses became apparent, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]], individuals began asking for changes to the Articles. Their hope was to create a stronger national government. Initially, some states met to deal with their trade and economic problems. However, as more states became interested in meeting to change the Articles, a meeting was set in Philadelphia on May 25, 1787. This became the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]]. It was quickly realized that changes would not work, and instead the entire Articles needed to be replaced.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley|first=Martin|title=Why did the Articles of Confederation fail?|publisher=About Education|url=http://americanhistory.about.com/od/governmentandpolitics/f/articles_of_confederation_fails.htm|accessdate=March 2, 2017}}</ref> On March 4, 1789, the government under the Articles was replaced with the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]].<ref>{{cite book| last = Rodgers| first = Paul| title = United States Constitutional Law: An Introduction| url = https://books.google.com/?id=WUOXmAEACAAJ&pg=PA109| year = 2011| publisher = McFarland| isbn = 978-0-7864-6017-5| page = 109 }}</ref> The new Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government by establishing a chief executive (the [[President of the United States|President]]), courts, and taxing powers.\n\n==Background and context==\nThe political push to increase cooperation among the then-loyal colonies began with the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754 and [[Benjamin Franklin]]'s proposed [[Albany Plan of Union]], an inter-colonial collaboration to help solve mutual local problems. The Articles of Confederation would bear some resemblance to it. Over the next two decades, some of the basic concepts it addressed would strengthen and others would weaken, particularly the degree of deserved loyalty to the crown. With [[Boston Tea Party|civil disobedience]] resulting in coercive, and what the colonials perceived as [[Intolerable Acts|intolerable acts]] of Parliament, and [[Battle of Bunker Hill|armed conflict]] resulting in dissidents being [[Proclamation of Rebellion|proclaimed rebels]] and outside the King's protection, any loyalty remaining shifted toward independence and how to achieve it. In 1775, with events outpacing communications, the [[Second Continental Congress]] began acting as the [[provisional government]] that would run the [[American Revolutionary War]] and gain the colonies their collective independence.\n\nIt was an era of constitution writing\u2014most states were busy at the task\u2014and leaders felt the new nation must have a written constitution, even though other nations did not. During the war, Congress exercised an unprecedented level of political, diplomatic, military and economic authority. It adopted trade restrictions, established and maintained an army, issued [[fiat money]], created a military code and negotiated with foreign governments.<ref>{{cite book| last = Wood| first = Gordon S.| title = The Creation of the American Republic: 1776\u20131787| year = 1969| publisher = University of North Carolina Press| pages = 354\u201355 }}</ref>\n\nTo transform themselves from outlaws into a legitimate nation,  the colonists needed international recognition for their cause and foreign allies to support it. In early 1776, [[Thomas Paine]] argued in the closing pages of the first edition of ''[[Common Sense (pamphlet)|Common Sense]]'' that the \u201ccustom of nations\u201d demanded a formal declaration of American independence if any European power were to mediate a peace between the Americans and Great Britain. The monarchies of France and Spain in particular could not be expected to aid those they considered rebels against another legitimate monarch. Foreign courts needed to have American grievances laid before them persuasively in a \u201cmanifesto\u201d which could also reassure them that the Americans would be reliable trading partners. Without such a declaration, Paine concluded, \u201c[t]he custom of all courts is against us, and will be so, until, by an independence, we take rank with other nations.\u201d<ref>{{cite book| last = Paine| first = Thomas| editor-last = Foner| editor-first = Eric| editor-link = Eric Foner| title = Paine: Collected Writings| publisher = The Library of America |   isbn = 978-1-4286-2200-5| pages = 45\u20136| chapter = Common Sense| date = January 14, 1776 }} (Collection published 1995.)</ref>\n\nBeyond improving their existing [[Continental Association|association]], the records of the [[Second Continental Congress]] show that the need for a declaration of independence was intimately linked with the demands of international relations. On June 7, 1776, [[Richard Henry Lee]] introduced [[Lee Resolution|a resolution]] before the Continental Congress declaring the colonies independent; at the same time he also urged Congress to resolve \u201cto take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances\u201d and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Congress then created three overlapping committees to draft the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration]], a [[Model Treaty]], and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states' entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states; and the Articles of Confederation, which established \u201ca firm league\u201d among the thirteen free and independent states, constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for the conduct of vital domestic and foreign affairs.<ref>{{Cite journal |author-link= David Armitage (historian) |first= David |last=  Armitage |url= http://maghis.oxfordjournals.org/content/18/3/61.full |title= The Declaration of Independence in World Context |publisher= [[Organization of American Historians]] |journal= Magazine of History |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |pages= 61\u201366 |year= 2004 |doi=10.1093/maghis/18.3.61}}</ref>\n\n==Drafting==\n[[File:Articles of Confederation 1977 Issue-13c.jpg|thumb|220px|<center>Articles of Confederation 200th Anniversary commemorative stamp.</center><center>First issued in York, Pennsylvania., 1977</center>]]\nOn June 12, 1776, a day after appointing a committee to prepare a draft of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], the Second Continental Congress resolved to appoint a committee of 13 to prepare a draft of a constitution for a union of the states.

Under the Articles, the states retained sovereignty over all governmental functions not specifically relinquished to the national government.  The individual articles set the rules for current and future operations of the United States government. It was made capable of making war and peace, negotiating diplomatic and commercial agreements with foreign countries, and deciding disputes between the states, including their additional and contested western territories.

There was no president, no executive agencies, no judiciary and no tax base. The absence of a tax base meant that there was no way to pay off state and national debts from the war years except by requesting money from the states, which seldom arrived.\n\nIn 1788, with the approval of Congress, the Articles were replaced by the [[United States Constitution]] and the new government began operations in 1789.<ref>{{cite book| last = Morris| first = Richard| title = The Forging of the Union, 1782\u20131789| year = 1988| publisher = HarperCollins Publishers| pages = 245\u201366 }}</ref>\n\n==Ratification==\nCongress began to move for ratification of the Articles of Confederation in 1777:\n\n{{quote|Permit us, then, earnestly to recommend these articles to the immediate and dispassionate attention of the legislatures of the respective states.

The preamble declares that the states \"agree to certain articles of Confederation and perpetual Union.\"\nWhat follows here summarizes the purpose and content of each of the thirteen articles.\n# Establishes the name of the confederation with these words: \"The stile of this confederacy shall be 'The United States of America.'\"\n# Asserts the sovereignty of each state, except for the specific powers delegated to the confederation government: \"Each state retains its sovereignty, freedom, and independence, and every power, jurisdiction, and right, which is not by this Confederation expressly delegated.\"\n# Declares the purpose of the confederation: \"The said States hereby severally enter into a firm league of friendship with each other, for their common defense, the security of their liberties, and their mutual and general welfare, binding themselves to assist each other, against all force offered to, or attacks made upon them, or any of them, on account of religion, sovereignty, trade, or any other pretense whatever.\"\n# Elaborates upon the intent \"to secure and perpetuate mutual friendship and intercourse among the people of the different States in this union,\" and to establish [[Equality before the law|equal treatment]] and [[freedom of movement]] for the free inhabitants of each state to pass unhindered between the states, excluding \"[[pauper]]s, [[vagabond (person)|vagabonds]], and [[fugitive]]s from justice.\" All these people are entitled to equal rights established by the state into which they travel. If a crime is committed in one state and the perpetrator flees to another state, he will be [[extradition|extradited]] to and tried in the state in which the crime was committed.\n# Allocates one vote in the [[Congress of the Confederation]] (the \"United States in Congress Assembled\") to each state, which is entitled to a delegation of between two and seven members. Members of Congress are to be appointed by state legislatures. No congressman may serve more than three out of any six years.\n# Only the central government may declare war, or conduct foreign political or commercial relations. No state or official may accept foreign gifts or titles, and granting any title of nobility is forbidden to all. No states may form any sub-national groups. No state may tax or interfere with treaty stipulations [[Model Treaty|already proposed]]. No state may wage war without permission of Congress, unless invaded or under imminent attack on the frontier; no state may maintain a peacetime standing army or navy, unless infested by pirates, but every State is required to keep ready, a well-trained, disciplined, and equipped militia.\n# Whenever an army is raised for common defense, the state legislatures shall assign military ranks of colonel and below.\n# Expenditures by the United States of America will be paid with funds raised by state legislatures, and apportioned to the states in proportion to the real property values of each.\n# Powers and functions of the United States in Congress Assembled. \n#* Grants to the United States in Congress assembled the sole and exclusive right and power to determine peace and war; to exchange ambassadors; to enter into treaties and alliances, with some provisos; to establish rules for deciding all cases of captures or prizes on land or water; to grant [[Letter of marque|letters of marque and reprisal]] (documents authorizing [[privateer]]s) in times of peace; to appoint courts for the trial of pirates and crimes committed on the high seas; to establish [[Court of Appeals in Cases of Capture|courts for appeals in all cases of captures]], but no member of Congress may be appointed a judge; to set weights and measures (including coins), and for Congress to serve as a final court for disputes between states.\n#* The court will be composed of jointly appointed commissioners or Congress shall appoint them. Each commissioner is bound by oath to be impartial. The court's decision is final.\n#* Congress shall regulate the post offices; appoint officers in the military; and regulate the armed forces.\n#* The United States in Congress assembled may appoint a president who shall not serve longer than one year per three-year term of the Congress.\n#* Congress may request requisitions from the states in proportion with their population, or take credit.\n#* Congress may not declare war, enter into treaties and alliances, appropriate money, or appoint a commander in chief without nine states assented. Congress shall keep a journal of proceedings and adjourn for periods not to exceed six months.\n# When Congress is in recess, any of the powers of Congress may be executed by \"The committee of the states, or any nine of them\", except for those powers of Congress which require nine states ''in'' Congress to execute.\n# If \"Canada\" (as the British-held [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] was also known) accedes to this confederation, it will be admitted.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/artconf.asp |title= Articles of Confederation}}</ref> No other colony could be admitted without the consent of nine states.\n# Reaffirms that the Confederation accepts war debt incurred by Congress before the existence of the Articles.\n# Declares that the Articles shall be perpetual, and may be altered only with the approval of Congress and the ratification of all the state legislatures.\n\nWhile still at war with Britain, the revolution's leaders were divided between forming a national government with powers either strong and centralized (the \"federalists\"), or strictly limited (the \"anti federalists\").  The Continental Congress compromised by dividing sovereignty between the states and the central government, with a [[unicameral]] legislature that protected the liberty of the individual states. It empowered Congress to regulate military and monetary affairs, for example, but provided no mechanism to compel the States to comply with requests for either troops or funding. This left the military vulnerable to inadequate funding, supplies, or even food.<ref>{{cite book| last = Carp| first = E.

Yet Congress had no power to enforce attendance. In September 1783, George Washington complained that Congress was paralyzed.<ref>''Congress have come to no determination ''yet'' respecting the Peace Establishment nor am I able to say when they will. I have lately had a conference with a Committee on this subject, and have reiterated my former opinions, but it appears to me that there is not a sufficient representation to discuss ''Great'' National points.''[http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/mgw:@field(DOCID+@lit(gw270170)) Letter George Washington to George Clinton], September 11, 1783. [http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/gwhtml/gwhome.html The George Washington Papers, 1741\u20131799]</ref> Many revolutionaries had gone to their respective home countries after the war, and local government and self-rule seemed quite satisfactory.\n\n==Function==\n\n===The Army===\nThe Articles supported the Congressional direction of the [[Continental Army]], and allowed the states to present a unified front when dealing with the European powers. As a tool to build a centralized war-making government, they were largely a failure: Historian Bruce Chadwick wrote:\n\n{{quote|George Washington had been one of the very first proponents of a strong federal government. The army had nearly disbanded on several occasions during the winters of the war because of the weaknesses of the Continental Congress. ... The delegates could not draft soldiers and had to send requests for regular troops and militia to the states. Congress had the right to order the production and purchase of provisions for the soldiers, but could not force anyone to supply them, and the army nearly starved in several winters of war.<ref>Chadwick p. 469. Phelps pp. 165\u2013166. Phelps wrote:\n:\"It is hardly surprising, given their painful confrontations with a weak central government and the sovereign states, that the former generals of the Revolution as well as countless lesser officers strongly supported the creation of a more muscular union in the 1780s and fought hard for the ratification of the Constitution in 1787. Their wartime experiences had nationalized them.\"</ref>}}\n\nThe Continental Congress, before the Articles were approved, had promised soldiers a pension of half pay for life. However Congress had no power to compel the states to fund this obligation, and as the war wound down after the victory at Yorktown the sense of urgency to support the military was no longer a factor. No progress was made in Congress during the winter of 1783\u201384. General Henry Knox, who would later become the first [[Secretary of War]] under the Constitution, blamed the weaknesses of the Articles for the inability of the government to fund the army. The army had long been supportive of a strong union.<ref>Puls pp. 174\u2013176</ref> Knox wrote:\n\n{{quote|The army generally have always reprobated the idea of being thirteen armies. Their ardent desires have been to be one continental body looking up to one sovereign. ... It is a favorite toast in the army, \"A hoop to the barrel\" or \"Cement to the Union\".<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\">Puls p. 177</ref>}}\n\nAs Congress failed to act on the petitions, Knox wrote to Gouverneur Morris, four years before the Philadelphia Convention was convened, \"As the present Constitution is so defective, why do not you great men call the people together and tell them so; that is, to have a convention of the States to form a better Constitution.\"<ref name=\"Puls p. 177\" />\n\nOnce the war had been won, the [[Continental Army]] was largely disbanded. A very small national force was maintained to man the frontier forts and to protect against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] attacks. Meanwhile, each of the states had an army (or militia), and 11 of them had Navies. The wartime promises of bounties and land grants to be paid for service were not being met. In 1783, [[George Washington]] defused the [[Newburgh conspiracy]], but riots by unpaid [[Pennsylvania]] veterans forced Congress to leave Philadelphia temporarily.<ref>{{cite book| last = Lodge| first = Henry Cabot| title = George Washington, Vol. I| url = http://www.fulltextarchive.com/page/George-Washington-Vol-I4/#p98| volume = I| year = 1893 }}</ref>\n\nThe Congress from time to time during the Revolutionary War requisitioned troops from the states. Any contributions were voluntary, and in the debates of 1788 the Federalists (who supported the proposed new Constitution) claimed that state politicians acted unilaterally, and contributed when the Continental army protected their state's interests. The Anti-Federalists claimed that state politicians understood their duty to the Union and contributed to advance its needs. Dougherty (2009) concludes that generally the States' behavior validated the Federalist analysis. This helps explain why the Articles of Confederation needed reforms.<ref>{{cite journal |first= Keith L. |last= Dougherty |title= An Empirical Test of Federalist and Anti-Federalist Theories of State Contributions, 1775\u20131783 |journal= Social Science History |date=  Spring 2009 |volume= 33 |issue= 1 |pages= 47\u201374 |doi=10.1215/01455532-2008-015}}</ref>\n\n===Foreign policy===\nEven after peace had been achieved in 1783, the weakness of the Confederation government frustrated the ability of the government to conduct foreign policy. In 1789, [[Thomas Jefferson]], concerned over the failure to fund an American naval force to confront the [[Barbary pirates]], wrote to [[James Monroe]], \"It will be said there is no money in the treasury. There never will be money in the treasury till the Confederacy shows its teeth. The states must see the rod.\u201d<ref>Ellis 92</ref>\n\nFurthermore, the [[Jay\u2013Gardoqui Treaty]] with [[Spain]] in 1789 also showed weakness in foreign policy. In this treaty \u2014 which was never ratified due to its immense unpopularity \u2014 the United States was to give up rights to use the [[Mississippi River]] for 25 years, which would have economically strangled the settlers west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Finally, due to the Confederation's military weakness, it could not compel the [[British army]] to leave frontier forts which were on American soil \u2014 forts which, in 1783, the British promised to leave, but which they delayed leaving pending U.S. implementation of other provisions such as ending action against [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]]s and allowing them to seek compensation. This incomplete British implementation of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] was superseded by the implementation of [[Jay's Treaty]] in 1795 under the new [[U.S. Constitution]].\n\n===Taxation and commerce===\nUnder the Articles of Confederation, the central government's power was kept quite limited. The Confederation Congress could make decisions, but lacked enforcement powers. Implementation of most decisions, including modifications to the Articles, required unanimous approval of all thirteen state legislatures.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The New Nation: A History of the United States During the Confederation, 1781\u20131789| year = 1950| publisher = Northeastern University Press| isbn = 978-0-930350-14-7| pages = 177\u2013233 }}</ref>\n\nCongress was denied any powers of [[taxation]]: it could only request money from the states. The states often failed to meet these requests in full, leaving both Congress and the Continental Army chronically short of money. As more money was printed by Congress, the continental dollars depreciated. In 1779, George Washington wrote to [[John Jay]], who was serving as the president of the Continental Congress, \"that a wagon load of money will scarcely purchase a wagon load of provisions.\"<ref>Stahr p. 105</ref> Mr. Jay and the Congress responded in May by requesting $45&nbsp;million from the States. In an appeal to the States to comply, Jay wrote that the taxes were \"the price of liberty, the peace, and the safety of yourselves and posterity.\"<ref>Stahr p. 107</ref> He argued that Americans should avoid having it said \"that America had no sooner become independent than she became insolvent\" or that \"her infant glories and growing fame were obscured and tarnished by broken contracts and violated faith.\"<ref>Stahr pp. 107\u2013108</ref> The States did not respond with any of the money requested from them.\n\nCongress had also been denied the power to regulate either foreign trade or [[interstate commerce]] and, as a result, all of the States maintained control over their own trade policies. The states and the Confederation Congress both incurred large debts during the Revolutionary War, and how to repay those debts became a major issue of debate following the War. Some States paid off their war debts and others did not. Federal assumption of the states' war debts became a major issue in the deliberations of the Constitutional Convention.\n\n===Accomplishments of the Confederation===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2017}}\n{{details|Admission to the Union#Articles of Confederation}}\nNevertheless, the Confederation Congress did take two actions with long-lasting impact. The [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] and [[Northwest Ordinance]] created territorial government, set up protocols for the admission of new states and the division of land into useful units, and set aside land in each township for public use. This system represented a sharp break from imperial colonization, as in Europe, and provided the basis for the rest of American continental expansion through the 19th Century.\n\nThe [[Land Ordinance of 1785]] established both the general practices of land surveying in the west and northwest and the land ownership provisions used throughout the later westward expansion beyond the [[Mississippi River]].  Frontier lands were surveyed into the now-familiar squares of land called the [[township]] (36 square miles), the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section]] (one square mile), and the quarter section (160 [[acre]]s). This system was carried forward to most of the States west of the Mississippi (excluding areas of [[Texas]] and [[California]] that had already been surveyed and divided up by the [[Spanish Empire]]). Then, when the [[Homestead Act]] was enacted in 1867, the quarter section became the basic unit of land that was granted to new settler-farmers.\n\nThe [[Northwest Ordinance]] of 1787 noted the agreement of the original states to give up [[state cession|northwestern land claims]], organized the [[Northwest Territory]] and laid the groundwork for the eventual creation of new states. While it didn't happen under the articles, the land north of the [[Ohio River]] and west of the (present) western border of Pennsylvania ceded by [[Massachusetts]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Virginia]], eventually became the states of: [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], [[Illinois]], [[Michigan]], and [[Wisconsin]], and the part of [[Minnesota]] east of the Mississippi River. The Northwest Ordinance of 1787 also made great advances in the abolition of slavery. New states admitted to the union in said territory would never be slave states.\n\nNo new states were admitted to the Union under the Articles of Confederation. The Articles provided for a blanket acceptance of the [[Province of Quebec (1763\u20131791)|Province of Quebec]] (referred to as \"Canada\" in the Articles) into the United States if it chose to do so. It did not, and the subsequent Constitution carried no such special provision of admission. Additionally, ordinances to admit [[State of Franklin|Frankland]] (later modified to Franklin),  [[Kentucky]], and [[Vermont Republic|Vermont]] to the Union were considered, but none were approved.\n\n==The United States of America under the Articles==\nThe peace treaty left the United States independent and at peace but with an unsettled governmental structure. The Articles envisioned a permanent confederation, but granted to the Congress\u2014the only federal institution\u2014little power to finance itself or to ensure that its resolutions were enforced. There was no president and no national court.<ref>{{cite book| last = Morris| first = Richard B.| title = The Forging of the Union, 1781\u20131789| year = 1987| publisher = Harper & Row| isbn = 978-0-06-091424-0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book| last = Frankel| first = Benjamin| title = History in Dispute: The American Revolution, 1763\u20131789| year = 2003| publisher = St James Press| pages = 17\u201324 }}</ref> Although historians generally agree that the Articles were too weak to hold the fast-growing nation together, they do give credit to the settlement of the western issue, as the states voluntarily turned over their lands to national control.<ref>{{cite book| last = McNeese| first = Tim| title = Revolutionary America 1764\u20131799| year = 2009| publisher = Chelsea House Pub| isbn = 978-1-60413-350-9| page = 104 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1783, with the end of the British blockade, the new nation was regaining its prosperity. However, trade opportunities were restricted by the mercantilism of the British and French empires. The ports of the British West Indies were closed to all staple products which were not carried in British ships. France and Spain established similar policies. Simultaneously, new manufacturers faced sharp competition from British products which were suddenly available again. Political unrest in several states and efforts by debtors to use popular government to erase their debts increased the anxiety of the political and economic elites which had led the Revolution. The apparent inability of the Congress to redeem the public obligations (debts) incurred during the war, or to become a forum for productive cooperation among the states to encourage commerce and economic development, only aggravated a gloomy situation. In 1786\u201387, [[Shays' Rebellion]], an uprising of dissidents in western Massachusetts against the state court system, threatened the stability of state government.<ref>{{cite book| last1 = Murrin| first1 = John M.| title = Liberty, Equality, Power, A History of the American People: To 1877| year = 2008| publisher = Wadsworth Publishing Company| isbn = 978-1-111-83086-1| page = 187}}</ref>\n\nThe Continental Congress printed paper money which was so depreciated that it ceased to pass as currency, spawning the expression \"not worth a continental\". Congress could not levy taxes and could only make requisitions upon the States. Less than a million and a half dollars came into the treasury between 1781 and 1784, although the governors had been asked for two million in 1783 alone.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| page = 37 }}</ref>\n\nWhen [[John Adams]] went to London in 1785 as the first representative of the United States, he found it impossible to secure a treaty for unrestricted commerce. Demands were made for favors and there was no assurance that individual states would agree to a treaty. Adams stated it was necessary for the States to confer the power of passing navigation laws to Congress, or that the States themselves pass retaliatory acts against Great Britain. Congress had already requested and failed to get power over navigation laws. Meanwhile, each State acted individually against Great Britain to little effect. When other New England states closed their ports to British shipping, Connecticut hastened to profit by opening its ports.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ferling| first = John| title = John Adams: A Life| year = 2010| publisher = Oxford University Press, USA| isbn = 978-0-19-975273-7| pages = 257\u20138 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1787 Congress was unable to protect manufacturing and shipping. State legislatures were unable or unwilling to resist attacks upon private contracts and public credit. Land speculators expected no rise in values when the government could not defend its borders nor protect its frontier population.<ref>{{cite book |first= Jack N. |last= Rakove |chapter= The Collapse of the Articles of Confederation |title= The American Founding: Essays on the Formation of the Constitution |editor1-first= J.

[[Alexander Hamilton]] realized while serving as Washington's top aide that a strong central government was necessary to avoid foreign intervention and allay the frustrations due to an ineffectual Congress. Hamilton led a group of like-minded nationalists, won Washington's endorsement, and convened the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]] in 1786 to petition Congress to call a constitutional convention to meet in Philadelphia to remedy the long-term crisis.<ref>{{cite book| last = Chernow| first = Ron| title = Alexander Hamilton| year = 2004| publisher = Penguin Books| isbn = 978-1-101-20085-8 }}</ref>\n\n==Signatures==\nThe Second Continental Congress approved the Articles for distribution to the states on November 15, 1777. A copy was made for each state and one was kept by the [[Continental Congress|Congress]]. On November 28, the copies sent to the states for ratification were unsigned, and the cover letter, dated November 17, had only the signatures of [[Henry Laurens]] and [[Charles Thomson]], who were the [[President of the Continental Congress|President]] and Secretary to the Congress.\n\nThe Articles, however, were unsigned, and the date was blank. Congress began the signing process by examining their copy of the Articles on June 27, 1778. They ordered a final copy prepared (the one in the National Archives), and that delegates should inform the secretary of their authority for ratification.\n\nOn July 9, 1778, the prepared copy was ready. They dated it, and began to sign. They also requested each of the remaining states to notify its delegation when ratification was completed. On that date, delegates present from [[New Hampshire]], [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], [[Connecticut]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Virginia]] and [[South Carolina]] signed the Articles to indicate that their states had ratified. [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]] and [[Maryland]] could not, since their states had not ratified. [[North Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] also didn't sign that day, since their delegations were absent.\n\nAfter the first signing, some delegates signed at the next meeting they attended. For example, John Wentworth of New Hampshire added his name on August 8. John Penn was the first of North Carolina's delegates to arrive (on July 10), and the delegation signed the Articles on July 21, 1778.\n\nThe other states had to wait until they ratified the Articles and notified their Congressional delegation. Georgia signed on July 24, New Jersey on November 26, and Delaware on February 12, 1779. Maryland refused to ratify the Articles until every state had ceded its western land claims.\n\n[[Image:Act of Maryland to ratify Articles.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Act of the Maryland legislature to ratify the Articles of Confederation on February 2, 1781]]\nOn February 2, 1781, the much-awaited decision was taken by the [[Maryland General Assembly]] in [[Annapolis]].<ref name=\"lawsofmaryland\">{{cite web  |date= February 2, 1781 |work= Laws of Maryland, 1781 |url= http://aomol.net/megafile/msa/speccol/sc2900/sc2908/000001/000203/html/am203--265.html |title= An ACT to empower the delegates}}</ref> As the last piece of business during the afternoon Session, \"among engrossed Bills\" was \"signed and sealed by Governor [[Thomas Sim Lee]] in the Senate Chamber, in the presence of the members of both Houses... an Act to empower the delegates of this state in Congress to subscribe and ratify the articles of confederation\" and perpetual union among the states. The Senate then adjourned \"to the first Monday in August next.\" The decision of Maryland to ratify the Articles was reported to the Continental Congress on February 12. The confirmation signing of the Articles by the two Maryland delegates took place in Philadelphia at noon time on March 1, 1781, and was celebrated in the afternoon. With these events, the Articles were entered into force and the United States of America came into being as a sovereign federal state.\n\nCongress had debated the Articles for over a year and a half, and the ratification process had taken nearly three and a half years. Many participants in the original debates were no longer delegates, and some of the signers had only recently arrived. The Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union were signed by a group of men who were never present in the Congress at the same time.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Signers===\nThe signers and the states they represented were:\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-1-of-5}}\n'''[[Connecticut]]'''\n* [[Roger Sherman]]\n* [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]]\n* [[Oliver Wolcott]]\n* [[Titus Hosmer]]\n* [[Andrew Adams (congressman)|Andrew Adams]]\n\n'''[[Delaware]]'''\n* [[Thomas McKean]]\n* [[John Dickinson (delegate)|John Dickinson]]\n* [[Nicholas Van Dyke (governor)|Nicholas Van Dyke]]\n\n'''[[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]'''\n* [[John Walton (1738\u20131783)|John Walton]]\n* [[Edward Telfair]]\n* [[Edward Langworthy]]\n{{col-2-of-5}}\n'''[[Maryland]]'''\n* [[John Hanson]]\n* [[Daniel Carroll]]\n\n'''[[Massachusetts|Massachusetts Bay]]'''\n* [[John Hancock]]\n* [[Samuel Adams]]\n* [[Elbridge Gerry]]\n* [[Francis Dana]]\n* [[James Lovell (delegate)|James Lovell]]\n* [[Samuel Holten]]\n\n'''[[New Hampshire]]'''\n* [[Josiah Bartlett]]\n* [[John Wentworth Jr.]]\n\n{{col-3-of-5}}\n'''[[New Jersey]]'''\n* [[John Witherspoon]]\n* [[Nathaniel Scudder]]\n\n'''[[New York (state)|New York]]'''\n* [[James Duane]]\n* [[Francis Lewis]]\n* [[William Duer (delegate)|William Duer]]\n* [[Gouverneur Morris]]\n\n'''[[North Carolina]]'''\n* [[John Penn (delegate)|John Penn]]\n* [[Cornelius Harnett]]\n* [[John Williams (delegate)|John Williams]]\n{{col-4-of-5}}\n'''[[Pennsylvania]]'''\n* [[Robert Morris (merchant)|Robert Morris]]\n* [[Daniel Roberdeau]]\n* [[Jonathan Bayard Smith]]\n* [[William Clingan]]\n* [[Joseph Reed (jurist)|Joseph Reed]]\n\n'''[[Rhode Island|Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]]'''\n* [[William Ellery]]\n* [[Henry Marchant]]\n* [[John Collins (delegate)|John Collins]]\n{{col-5-of-5}}\n'''[[South Carolina]]'''\n* [[Henry Laurens]]\n* [[William Henry Drayton]]\n* [[John Mathews (lawyer)|John Mathews]]\n* [[Richard Hutson]]\n* [[Thomas Heyward Jr.]]\n\n'''[[Virginia]]'''\n* [[Richard Henry Lee]]\n* [[John Banister (lawyer)|John Banister]]\n* [[Thomas Adams (politician)|Thomas Adams]]\n* [[John Harvie]]\n* [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nRoger Sherman (Connecticut) was the only person to sign all four great state papers of the United States: the [[Continental Association]], the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.\n\nRobert Morris (Pennsylvania) signed three of the great state papers of the United States: the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution.\n\nJohn Dickinson (Delaware), Daniel Carroll (Maryland) and Gouverneur Morris (New York), along with Sherman and Robert Morris, were the only five people to sign both the Articles of Confederation and the United States Constitution (Gouverneur Morris represented Pennsylvania when signing the Constitution).\n\n==Presidents of the Congress==\nThe following list is of those who led the [[Congress of the Confederation]] under the Articles of Confederation as the [[President of the United States in Congress Assembled|Presidents of the United States in Congress Assembled]].

He was not, however, an executive in the way the successor [[President of the United States]] is a chief executive, since all of the functions he executed were under the direct control of Congress.<ref>{{cite book| last = Jensen| first = Merrill| title = The Articles of Confederation: An Interpretation of the Social-Constitutional History of the American Revolution, 1774\u20131781| year = 1959| publisher = University of Wisconsin Press| isbn = 978-0-299-00204-6| pages = 178\u2013179 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! width=\"150\"|President of Congress\n! width=\"125\"|Office Start\n! width=\"125\"|Office Exit\n|-\n| [[Samuel Huntington (statesman)|Samuel Huntington]] ||March 1, 1781 || July 9, 1781\n|-\n| [[Thomas McKean]] ||July 10, 1781 || November 4, 1781\n|-\n| [[John Hanson]] ||November 5, 1781 || November 3, 1782\n|-\n| [[Elias Boudinot]] ||November 4, 1782 || November 2, 1783\n|-\n| [[Thomas Mifflin]] ||November 3, 1783 || October 31, 1784\n|-\n| [[Richard Henry Lee]] ||November 30, 1784 || November 6, 1785\n|-\n| [[John Hancock]] ||November 23, 1785 || May 29, 1786\n|-\n| [[Nathaniel Gorham]] ||June 6, 1786 || November 5, 1786\n|-\n| [[Arthur St. Clair]] ||February 2, 1787 || November 4, 1787\n|-\n| [[Cyrus Griffin]] ||January 22, 1788 || November 2, 1788\n|}\n\n''For a full list of Presidents of the Congress Assembled and Presidents under the two Continental Congresses before the Articles, see [[President of the Continental Congress]].''\n\n==Gallery==\nImages of an original draft{{Clarify|What is the provenance of this document?|date=August 2015}} of the Articles of Confederation stored at the United States [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archive]].\n<gallery>\nImage:Articles of Confederation 1-5.jpg|Preamble through Article V, \u00b61\nImage:Articles of Confederation 5-6.jpg|Article V, \u00b62 through Article VI\nImage:Articles of Confederation 7-9.jpg|Article VII through Article IX, \u00b62\nImage:Articles of Confederation 9-9.jpg|Article IX, \u00b62 through \u00b65\nImage:Articles of Confederation 9-13.jpg|Article IX, \u00b65 through Article XIII, \u00b62\nImage:Articles of Confederation 13.jpg|Article XIII, \u00b62 through signatures\n</gallery>\n\n==Revision and replacement==\nOn January 21, 1786, the Virginia Legislature, following [[James Madison]]'s recommendation, invited all the states to send delegates to Annapolis, Maryland to discuss ways to reduce interstate conflict. At what came to be known as the [[Annapolis Convention (1786)|Annapolis Convention]], the few state delegates in attendance endorsed a motion that called for all states to meet in [[Philadelphia]] in May 1787 to discuss ways to improve the Articles of Confederation in a \"Grand Convention.\" Although the states' representatives to the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia were only authorized to amend the Articles, the representatives held secret, closed-door sessions and wrote a new constitution. The new Constitution gave much more power to the central government, but characterization of the result is disputed. The general goal of the authors was to get close to a [[republic]] as defined by the philosophers of the [[Age of Enlightenment]], while trying to address the many difficulties of the interstate relationships. Historian Forrest McDonald, using the ideas of James Madison from ''Federalist 39'', describes the change this way:\n\n{{quote|The constitutional reallocation of powers created a new form of government, unprecedented under the sun. Every previous national authority either had been centralized or else had been a confederation of sovereign states. The new American system was neither one nor the other; it was a mixture of both.<ref>McDonald pg. 276</ref>}}\n\nIn May 1786, [[Charles Pinckney (governor)|Charles Pinckney]] of [[South Carolina]] proposed that Congress revise the Articles of Confederation. Recommended changes included granting [[United States Congress|Congress]] power over foreign and domestic commerce, and providing means for Congress to collect money from state treasuries. Unanimous approval was necessary to make the alterations, however, and Congress failed to reach a consensus. The weakness of the Articles in establishing an effective unifying government was underscored by the threat of internal conflict both within and between the states, especially after [[Shays' Rebellion]] threatened to topple the state government of Massachusetts.\n\nHistorian Ralph Ketcham comments on the opinions of [[Patrick Henry]], [[George Mason]], and other [[Anti-Federalism|Anti-Federalists]] who were not so eager to give up the local autonomy won by the revolution:\n\n{{quote|Antifederalists feared what Patrick Henry termed the \"consolidated government\" proposed by the new Constitution. They saw in Federalist hopes for commercial growth and international prestige only the lust of ambitious men for a \"splendid empire\" that, in the time-honored way of empires, would oppress the people with taxes, conscription, and military campaigns. Uncertain that any government over so vast a domain as the United States could be controlled by the people, Antifederalists saw in the enlarged powers of the general government only the familiar threats to the rights and liberties of the people.<ref>{{cite book| last = Ketcham| first = Ralph| title = Roots of the Republic: American Founding Documents Interpreted| url = https://books.google.com/?id=QlDPAtJXQu0C&pg=PA381| year = 1990| publisher = Rowman & Littlefield| isbn = 978-0-945612-19-3| page = 383 }}</ref>}}\n\nHistorians have given many reasons for the perceived need to replace the articles in 1787. Jillson and Wilson (1994) point to the financial weakness as well as the norms, rules and institutional structures of the Congress, and the propensity to divide along sectional lines.\n\nRakove (1988) identifies several factors that explain the collapse of the Confederation. The lack of compulsory direct taxation power was objectionable to those wanting a strong centralized state or expecting to benefit from such power. It could not collect customs after the war because tariffs were vetoed by [[Rhode Island]]. Rakove concludes that their failure to implement national measures \"stemmed not from a heady sense of independence but rather from the enormous difficulties that all the states encountered in collecting taxes, mustering men, and gathering supplies from a war-weary populace.\"<ref>Rakove 1988 p. 230</ref> The second group of factors Rakove identified derived from the substantive nature of the problems the Continental Congress confronted after 1783, especially the inability to create a strong foreign policy. Finally, the Confederation's lack of coercive power reduced the likelihood for profit to be made by political means, thus potential rulers were uninspired to seek power.\n\nWhen the war ended in 1783, certain special interests had incentives to create a new \"merchant state,\" much like the British state people had rebelled against. In particular, holders of war scrip and land speculators wanted a central government to pay off scrip at face value and to legalize western land holdings with disputed claims. Also, manufacturers wanted a high tariff as a barrier to foreign goods, but competition among states made this impossible without a central government.<ref>Hendrickson p. 154</ref>\n\n===Legitimacy of closing down===\nPolitical scientist David C. Hendrickson writes that two prominent political leaders in the Confederation, [[John Jay]] of New York and [[Thomas Burke (governor)|Thomas Burke]] of North Carolina believed that \"the authority of the congress rested on the prior acts of the several states, to which the states gave their voluntary consent, and until those obligations were fulfilled, neither nullification of the authority of congress, exercising its due powers, nor secession from the compact itself was consistent with the terms of their original pledges.\"<ref>Hendrickson p. 153\u2013154</ref>\n\nAccording to Article XIII of the Confederation, any alteration had to be approved unanimously: \n<blockquote>[T]he Articles of this Confederation shall be inviolably observed by every State, and the Union shall be perpetual; nor shall any alteration at any time hereafter be made in any of them; unless such alteration be agreed to in a Congress of the United States, and be afterwards confirmed by the legislatures of every State.</blockquote>\n\nOn the other hand, Article VII of the proposed Constitution stated that it would become effective after ratification by a mere nine states, without unanimity:\n<blockquote>The Ratification of the Conventions of nine States, shall be sufficient for the Establishment of this Constitution between the States so ratifying the Same.</blockquote>\n\nThe apparent tension between these two provisions was addressed at the time, and remains a topic of scholarly discussion.  In 1788, [[James Madison]] remarked (in ''[[Federalist No. 40]]'') that the issue had become moot: \"As this objection...has been in a manner waived by those who have criticised the powers of the convention, I dismiss it without further observation.\"  Nevertheless, it is an interesting historical and legal question whether opponents of the Constitution could have plausibly attacked the Constitution on that ground.  At the time, there were state legislators who argued that the Constitution was not an alteration of the Articles of Confederation, but rather would be a complete replacement so the unanimity rule did not apply.<ref name=Maier>Maier, Pauline.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=-DvolFMBVRgC&pg=PA62 Ratification: The People Debate the Constitution, 1787-1788]'', p. 62 (Simon and Schuster, 2011).</ref>  Moreover, the Confederation had proven woefully inadequate and therefore was supposedly no longer binding.<ref name=Maier />\n\nModern scholars such as Francisco Forrest Martin agree that the Articles of Confederation had lost its binding force because many states had violated it, and thus \"other states-parties did not have to comply with the Articles' unanimous consent rule\".<ref>Martin, Francisco.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xNEjqp2A6ZgC&pg=PA5 The Constitution as Treaty: The International Legal Constructionalist Approach to the U.S. Constitution]'', p. 5 (Cambridge University Press, 2007).</ref>  In contrast, law professor [[Akhil Amar]] suggests that there may not have really been any conflict between the Articles of Confederation and the Constitution on this point; Article VI of the Confederation specifically allowed side deals among states, and the Constitution could be viewed as a side deal until all states ratified it.<ref>Amar, Akhil.  ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xfkJRm6VCQ0C&pg=PA517 America's Constitution: A Biography]'', p. 517 (Random House 2012).</ref>\n\n===Final months===\nOn July 3, 1788, the Congress received [[New Hampshire]]'s all-important ninth ratification of the proposed Constitution, thus, according to its terms, establishing it as the new framework of governance for the ratifying states. The following day delegates considered a bill to admit Kentucky into the Union as a sovereign state. The discussion ended with Congress making the determination that, in light of this development, it would be \"unadvisable\" to admit Kentucky into the Union, as it could do so \"under the Articles of Confederation\" only, but not \"under the Constitution\".<ref>{{cite journal| last1=Kesavan| first1=Vasan| title=When Did the Articles of Confederation Cease to Be Law| journal=Notre Dame Law Review|date=December 1, 2002|volume=78|issue=1|pages=70\u201371|url=http://scholarship.law.nd.edu/ndlr/vol78/iss1/3 |accessdate=October 31, 2015}}</ref>\n\nBy the end of July 1788, 11 of the 13 states had ratified the new Constitution.

Because of the ocean's great capacity to store and release heat, maritime climates are more moderate and have less extreme seasonal variations than inland climates. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] can be approximated from coastal weather data and air temperature from water temperatures.<ref name=\"USN-2001\" />\n\nThe oceans are the major source of the atmospheric moisture that is obtained through evaporation. Climatic zones vary with latitude; the warmest zones stretch across the Atlantic north of the equator. The coldest zones are in high latitudes, with the coldest regions corresponding to the areas covered by sea ice. Ocean currents influence climate by transporting warm and cold waters to other regions. The winds that are cooled or warmed when blowing over these currents influence adjacent land areas.<ref name=\"USN-2001\" />\n\nThe [[Gulf Stream]] and its northern extension towards Europe, the [[North Atlantic Current|North Atlantic Drift]] is thought to have at least some influence on climate. For example, the Gulf Stream helps moderate winter temperatures along the coastline of southeastern North America, keeping it warmer in winter along the coast than inland areas. The Gulf Stream also keeps extreme temperatures from occurring on the Florida Peninsula. In the higher latitudes, the North Atlantic Drift, warms the atmosphere over the oceans, keeping the British Isles and north-western Europe mild and cloudy, and not severely cold in winter like other locations at the same high latitude. The cold water currents contribute to heavy fog off the coast of eastern Canada (the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]] area) and Africa's north-western coast.  In general, winds transport moisture and air over land areas.<ref name=\"USN-2001\" />\n\n===Natural hazards===\n[[File:Iceberg A22A, South Atlantic Ocean.jpg|thumb|Iceberg A22A in the South Atlantic Ocean|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg with surrounding clouds|alt=Overhead photo of iceberg]]\n[[Iceberg]]s are common from February to August in the [[Davis Strait]], [[Denmark Strait]], and the northwestern Atlantic and have been spotted as far south as [[Bermuda]] and [[Madeira]].

As a matter of fact I hardly noticed Schopenhauer's disparagements of women when they came under my notice later on, so thoroughly had Mr Bax familiarized me with the homoist attitude, and forced me to recognize the extent to which public opinion, and consequently legislation and jurisprudence, is corrupted by feminist sentiment.\"</ref>)\n\n== Life ==\n[[File:Gdansk Schopenhauer House.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer's birthplace house, ul. \u015aw.

Portrait by <br />Ludwig Sigismund Ruhl]]\nA key focus of Schopenhauer was his investigation of individual motivation. Before Schopenhauer, Hegel had popularized the concept of ''[[Zeitgeist]]'', the idea that society consisted of a [[collective consciousness]] that moved in a distinct direction, dictating the actions of its members. Schopenhauer, a reader of both Kant and Hegel, criticized their logical optimism and the belief that individual morality could be determined by society and reason. Schopenhauer believed that humans were motivated by only their own basic desires, or {{lang|de|''Wille zum Leben''}} (\"Will to Live\"), which directed all of mankind.<ref>\"The reality is what Schopenhauer calls the Will, the Will to Live.\" Letter to Richard C. Lyon, 1 August 1949, [[George Santayana]], ''The Letters of George Santayana'', Scribner's, New York, 1955</ref> Will, for Schopenhauer, is what Kant called the \"[[Noumenon|thing-in-itself]]\".<ref>But like Fichte, he rejects the Kantian claim that the thing-in-itself as an unknowable substratum of experience. Schopenhauer's argument is that the thing in-itself in Kant is an incoherent sense of object: it is the opposite to objects, and yet it is said to be an object-in-itself: \"the phantom of a dream.\"</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, human desire was futile, illogical, directionless, and, by extension, so was all human action in the world. Einstein paraphrased his views as follows: \"Man can indeed do what he wants, but he cannot will what he wants.\" In this sense, he adhered to the Fichtean principle of idealism: \"The world is ''for'' a subject.\" This idealism so presented, immediately commits it to an ethical attitude, unlike the purely epistemological concerns of [[Descartes]] and [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]]. To Schopenhauer, the Will is a blind force that controls not only the actions of individual, intelligent agents, but ultimately all observable phenomena\u2014an evil to be terminated via mankind's duties: [[asceticism]] and chastity.<ref name=\"inveigles\"/> He is credited with one of the most famous opening lines of philosophy: \"The world is my representation.\" [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] was greatly influenced by this idea of Will, although he eventually rejected it.\n\n=== Art and aesthetics ===\n{{Main|Arthur Schopenhauer's aesthetics}}\nFor Schopenhauer, human desiring, \"willing\", and craving cause [[suffering|suffering or pain]]. A temporary way to escape this pain is through aesthetic contemplation (a method comparable to [[Zapffe]]'s \"''Sublimation''\"). Aesthetic contemplation allows one to escape this pain\u2014albeit temporarily\u2014because it stops one perceiving the world as mere presentation. Instead, one no longer perceives the world as an object of perception (therefore as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds; time, space and causality) from which one is separated; rather one becomes one with that perception: \"''one can thus no longer separate the perceiver from the perception''\" (''The World as Will and Representation'', section 34). From this immersion with the world one no longer views oneself as an individual who suffers in the world due to one's individual will but, rather, becomes a \"''subject of cognition''\" to a perception that is \"''Pure, will-less, timeless''\" (section 34) where the essence, \"ideas\", of the world are shown. Art is the practical consequence of this brief aesthetic contemplation as it attempts to depict one's immersion with the world, thus tries to depict the essence/pure ideas of the world. Music, for Schopenhauer, was the purest form of art because it was the one that depicted the will itself without it appearing as subject to the Principle of Sufficient Grounds, therefore as an individual object. According to Daniel Albright, \"Schopenhauer thought that [[philosophy of music|music]] was the only art that did not merely copy ideas, but actually embodied the will itself\".<ref>Daniel Albright, Modernism and Music, 2004, page 39, footnote 34</ref>\n\nHe deemed music a timeless, universal language comprehended everywhere, that can imbue global enthusiasm, if in possession of a significant melody.<ref name=Music >{{cite book|last=Schopenhauer|first=Arthur|title=Essays and Aphorisms|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Classics|location='10'|isbn=0-14-044227-8|pages=162}}</ref>\n\n=== Mathematics ===\nSchopenhauer's [[Philosophy of mathematics#Mathematical realism|realist]] views on mathematics are evident in his criticism of the contemporary attempts to prove the [[parallel postulate]] in [[Euclidean geometry]]. Writing shortly before the discovery of [[hyperbolic geometry]] demonstrated the logical independence of the axiom\u2014and long before the [[general theory of relativity]] revealed that it does not necessarily express a property of physical space\u2014Schopenhauer criticized mathematicians for trying to use indirect [[concept]]s to prove what he held to be directly evident from [[perception]].\n\n{{quote|text=The Euclidean method of demonstration has brought forth from its own womb its most striking parody and caricature in the famous controversy over the theory of ''parallels'', and in the attempts, repeated every year, to prove the eleventh axiom<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eleventh axiom is Euclid's Fifth Postulate.</ref> (also known as the fifth postulate). The [[axiom]] asserts, and that indeed through the indirect criterion of a third intersecting line, that two lines inclined to each other (for this is the precise meaning of \"less than two right angles\"), if produced far enough, must meet. Now this truth is supposed to be too complicated to pass as self-evident, and therefore needs a proof; but no such proof can be produced, just because there is nothing more immediate.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', vol. 2, chap. 13</ref>}}\n \nThroughout his writings,<ref>\"I wanted in this way to stress and demonstrate the great difference, indeed opposition, between knowledge of perception and abstract or reflected knowledge. Hitherto this difference has received too little attention, and its establishment is a fundamental feature of my philosophy\u2026\" ''Ibid.'', chap. 7.</ref> Schopenhauer criticized the logical derivation of philosophies and mathematics from mere concepts, instead of from intuitive perceptions.\n\n{{quote|text=In fact, it seems to me that the logical method is in this way reduced to an absurdity. But it is precisely through the controversies over this, together with the futile attempts to demonstrate the ''directly'' certain as merely ''indirectly'' certain, that the independence and clearness of intuitive evidence appear in contrast with the uselessness and difficulty of logical proof, a contrast as instructive as it is amusing. The direct certainty will not be admitted here, just because it is no merely logical certainty following from the concept, and thus resting solely on the relation of predicate to subject, according to the principle of contradiction. But that eleventh axiom regarding parallel lines is a [[synthetic proposition]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'', and as such has the guarantee of pure, not empirical, perception; this perception is just as immediate and certain as is the [[principle of contradiction]] itself, from which all proofs originally derive their certainty. At bottom this holds good of every geometrical theorem &hellip;.}}\n\nAlthough Schopenhauer could see no justification for trying to prove Euclid's parallel postulate, he did see a reason for examining another of Euclid's axioms.<ref>This comment by Schopenhauer was called \"an acute observation\" by [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]]. In his translation of [[Euclid's Elements|The Elements]], vol. 1, Book I, \"Note on Common Notion 4,\" Heath made this judgment and also noted that Schopenhauer's remark \"was a criticism in advance of [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Helmholtz']] theory.\" Helmholtz had \"maintained that geometry requires us to assume the actual existence of rigid bodies and their free mobility in space &hellip;\" and is therefore \"dependent on mechanics.\"</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=It surprises me that the eighth axiom,<ref>What Schopenhauer calls the eighth axiom is Euclid's Common Notion 4.</ref> \"Figures that coincide with one another are equal to one another,\" is not rather attacked. For \"''coinciding with one another''\" is either a mere [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]], or something quite [[empirical]], belonging not to pure intuition or perception, but to external sensuous experience. Thus it presupposes mobility of the figures, but [[matter]] alone is movable in [[space]]. Consequently, this reference to coincidence with one another forsakes pure space, the sole element of [[geometry]], in order to pass over to the material and empirical.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/>}}\nThis follows [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s reasoning.<ref>\u201dMotion of an ''object'' in space does not belong in a pure science, and consequently not in geometry. For the fact that something is movable cannot be cognized ''a priori'', but can be cognized only through experience.\u201d (Kant, ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'',  B 155, Note)</ref>\n\n=== Ethics ===\nSchopenhauer's moral theory proposed that only [[compassion]] can drive moral acts. According to Schopenhauer, compassion alone is the good of the object of the acts, that is, they cannot be inspired by either the prospect of personal utility or the feeling of duty. Mankind can also be guided by [[Ethical egoism|egoism]] and [[wikt:malice|malice]]. Egotistic acts are those guided by self-interest, desire for pleasure or happiness. Schopenhauer believed most of our deeds belong to this class. Acts of malice are different from egotistic acts. As in the case of acts of compassion, these do not target personal utility. Their aim is to cause damage to others, independently of personal gains. He believed, like [[Swami Vivekananda]] in the unity of all with one-self and also believed that ego is the origin of pain and conflicts, that reduction of ego frames the moral principles.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Barua|first1=edited by Arati|last2=Gerhard|first2=Michael|last3=Kossler|first3=Matthias|title=Understanding Schopenhauer through the prism of Indian culture philosophy, religion, and Sanskrit literature|date=2012|publisher=De Gruyter|location=Berlin|isbn=9783110271584|page=187|edition=1.

It does so by placing \"beside every possible motive for committing a wrong a more powerful motive for leaving it undone, in the inescapable punishment. Accordingly, the criminal code is as complete a register as possible of counter-motives to all criminal actions that can possibly be imagined...\"<ref name=twwr62>Schopenhauer, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, \u00a7 62.</ref>\n\n{{quote|text=...the law and its fulfillment, namely punishment, are directed essentially to the ''future'', not to the ''past''.

They can only be influenced by strong motives that overpower criminal motives.  Schopenhauer declared that \"real moral reform is not at all possible, but only determent from the deed...\".<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nHe claimed this doctrine was not original to him. Previously, it appeared in the writings of [[Plato]],<ref>\"... he who attempts to punish in accordance with reason does not retaliate on account of the past wrong (for he could not undo something which has been done) but for the sake of the future, so that neither the wrongdoer himself, nor others who see him being punished, will do wrong again.\" Plato, \"[[Protagoras (dialogue)|Protagoras]]\", 324 B. Plato wrote that punishment should \"be an example to other men not to offend.\" Plato, \"[[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]\", Book IX, 863.</ref> [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[Samuel von Pufendorf|Pufendorf]], and [[Paul Johann Anselm Ritter von Feuerbach|Anselm Feuerbach]]. Schopenhauer declared that their teaching was corrupted by subsequent errors and therefore was in need of clarification.<ref name=\"twwr62\"/>\n\n==== God ====\nEven though Schopenhauer ended his treatise on the freedom of human will with the postulate of everyone's responsibility for their character and, consequently, acts\u2014the responsibility following from one's being the Will as [[noumenon]] (from which also all the characters and creations come)\u2014he considered his views incompatible with [[theism]], on grounds of [[fatalism]] and, more generally, responsibility for evil. In Schopenhauer's philosophy the dogmas of Christianity lose their significance,<ref>...for they require [about Judaism] \"a man to come into the world as a moral blank, so that, in virtue of an inconceivable free will (...) he may choose whether he is to be an angel or a devil, or anything else that may lie between the two.\" (''On Human Nature'', c. 3).</ref> and the \"Last Judgment\" is no longer preceded by anything\u2014\"The world is itself the Last Judgment on it.\"<ref>A.

What is decided by it is nothing less than the composition of the next generation ...<ref>Schopenhauer, Arthur, [[:s:The World as Will and Representation/Supplements to the Fourth Book|''The World as Will and Representation'', Supplements to the Fourth Book]]</ref>\n\nThese ideas foreshadowed the [[evolution|discovery of evolution]], [[Sigmund Freud|Freud's]] concepts of the [[libido]] and the [[unconscious mind]], and [[evolutionary psychology]] in general.<ref>\"Nearly a century before Freud... in Schopenhauer there is, for the first time, an explicit philosophy of the unconscious and of the body.\" Safranski pg. 345.</ref>\n\n=== Political and social thought ===\n\n==== Politics ====\n[[File:FFM Wallanlagen Schopenhauer-Denkmal.jpg|thumb|Bust in [[Frankfurt am Main]]]]\nSchopenhauer's politics were, for the most part, an echo of his system of ethics (the latter being expressed in ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', available in English as two separate books, ''[[On the Basis of Morality]]'' and ''[[On the Freedom of the Will]]''). Ethics also occupies about one quarter of his central work, ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]''.\n\nIn occasional political comments in his ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'' and ''Manuscript Remains'', Schopenhauer described himself as a proponent of [[limited government]]. What was essential, he thought, was that the state should \"leave each man free to work out his own [[salvation]]\", and so long as government was thus limited, he would \"prefer to be ruled by a lion than one of [his] fellow rats\"\u2014i.e., by a [[monarch]], rather than a [[Republic|democrat]]. Schopenhauer shared the view of [[Thomas Hobbes]] on the necessity of the state, and of state action, to check the destructive tendencies innate to our species. He also defended the independence of the legislative, judicial and executive branches of power, and a monarch as an impartial element able to practise justice (in a practical and everyday sense, not a cosmological one).<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 47</ref> He declared monarchy as \"that which is natural to man\" for \"intelligence has always under a monarchical government a much better chance against its irreconcilable and ever-present foe, stupidity\" and disparaged republicanism as \"unnatural as it is unfavourable to the higher intellectual life and the arts and sciences\".<ref>[[s:Government (Schopenhauer)]]</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer, by his own admission, did not give much thought to politics, and several times he writes proudly of how little attention he had paid \"to political affairs of [his] day\".  In a life that spanned several revolutions in French and German government, and a few continent-shaking wars, he did indeed maintain his aloof position of \"minding not the times but the eternities\".  He wrote many disparaging remarks about Germany and the Germans. A typical example is, \"For a German it is even good to have somewhat lengthy words in his mouth, for he thinks slowly, and they give him time to reflect.\"<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 12</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer attributed civilizational primacy to the northern \"white races\" due to their sensitivity and creativity (except for the ancient Egyptians and Hindus whom he saw as equal):\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilization and culture, apart from the ancient Hindus and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmans, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is due to the fact that necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north, and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilization.<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer additionally maintained a marked metaphysical and political [[anti-Judaism]].  Schopenhauer argued that Christianity constituted a revolt against what he styled the materialistic basis of Judaism, exhibiting an Indian-influenced ethics reflecting the [[Aryan]]-[[Vedas|Vedic]] theme of spiritual \"self-conquest\".  This he saw as opposed to what he held to be the ignorant drive toward earthly utopianism and superficiality of a worldly \"Jewish\" spirit:\n\n<blockquote>While all other religions endeavor to explain to the people by symbols the metaphysical significance of life, the religion of the Jews is entirely immanent and furnishes nothing but a mere war-cry in the struggle with other nations.<ref>\"Fragments for the history of philosophy\", ''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==== Views on women ====\nIn Schopenhauer's 1851 essay ''On Women'', he expressed his opposition to what he called \"Teutonico-Christian stupidity\" of reflexive unexamined reverence (\"abgeschmackten Weiberveneration\")<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboq.org/schopenhauer/parerga2/weiber.htm|title=\u00dcber die Weiber,\u00a7369}}</ref> for the female. Schopenhauer wrote that \"Women are directly fitted for acting as the nurses and teachers of our early childhood by the fact that they are themselves childish, frivolous and short-sighted.\" He opined that women are deficient in artistic faculties and sense of justice, and expressed opposition to [[monogamy]].  Indeed, [[Nigel Rodgers|Rodgers]] and [[Mel Thompson|Thompson]] in ''[[Philosophers Behaving Badly]]'' call Schopenhauer \"a misogynist without rival in....Western philosophy\".  He claimed that \"woman is by nature meant to obey\". The essay does give some compliments, however: that \"women are decidedly more sober in their judgment than [men] are\", and are more sympathetic to the suffering of others.\n\nSchopenhauer's controversial writings have influenced many, from [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] to nineteenth-century [[feminists]].<ref>''Feminism and the Limits of Equality''\nPA Cain \u2013 Ga. L. Rev., 1989</ref> Schopenhauer's [[biology|biological]] analysis of the difference between the sexes, and their separate roles in the struggle for survival and reproduction, anticipates some of the claims that were later ventured by [[sociobiology|sociobiologists]] and [[evolutionary psychology|evolutionary psychologists]].<ref name=\"Young2005\">{{cite book|author=Julian Young|title=Schopenhauer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfDyeGY0RFMC&pg=PA242|date=23 June 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-33346-7|page=242}}</ref>\n\nAfter the elderly Schopenhauer sat for a sculpture portrait by [[Elisabet Ney]], he told Richard Wagner's friend [[Malwida von Meysenbug]], \"I have not yet spoken my last word about women.  I believe that if a woman succeeds in withdrawing from the mass, or rather raising herself above the mass, she grows ceaselessly and more than a man.\"<ref>Safranski (1990), Chapter 24. Page 348.</ref>\n\n==== Heredity and eugenics ====\n[[File:Frankfurt Am Main-Portraits-Arthur Schopenhauer-1845.jpg|thumb|upright|Schopenhauer at age 58 on 16 May 1846]]\nNote for clarity in the following that \"[[genetics]]\" are but one component of \"[[heredity]]\". Though commonly used interchangeably, \"heritable traits\" would include socio-economic and other psycho-social potentialities. (See e.g. [https://evolutionarybio.wordpress.com/2014/09/15/the-difference-between-genetic-and-hereditary/ The difference between genetic and hereditary | Evolutionary Biology]).\n\nSchopenhauer believed that personality and [[intellect]] were inherited. He quotes Horace's saying, \"From the brave and good are the brave descended\" (''Odes'', iv, 4, 29) and Shakespeare's line from ''[[Cymbeline]]'', \"Cowards father cowards, and base things sire base\" (IV, 2) to reinforce his hereditarian argument.<ref>Payne, ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. II, p. 519</ref>\nMechanistically, Schopenhauer believed that a person inherits his level of intellect through his mother, and personal character through one's father.<ref>On the Suffering of the World, (1970), Page 35. Penguin Books-Great Ideas</ref>\nThis belief in heritability of traits informed Schopenhauer's view of love \u2013 placing it at the highest level of importance. For Schopenhauer the \"final aim of all love intrigues, be they comic or tragic, is really of more importance than all other ends in human life. What it all turns upon is nothing less than the composition of the next generation.... It is not the weal or woe of any one individual, but that of the human race to come, which is here at stake.\" This view of the importance for the species of whom we choose to love was reflected in his views on [[eugenics]] or good breeding. Here Schopenhauer wrote:\n\n<blockquote>With our knowledge of the complete unalterability both of character and of mental faculties, we are led to the view that a real and thorough improvement of the human race might be reached not so much from outside as from within, not so much by theory and instruction as rather by the path of generation. Plato had something of the kind in mind when, in the fifth book of his ''Republic'', he explained his plan for increasing and improving his warrior caste. If we could [[castrate]] all [[criminals|scoundrels]] and stick all stupid geese in a convent, and give men of noble character a whole [[harem]], and procure men, and indeed thorough men, for all girls of intellect and understanding, then a generation would soon arise which would produce a better age than that of [[Pericles]].<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = The World as Will and Representation |editor=E.

This proposal constitutes my Utopia and my Platonic Republic.\"<ref>''Essays and Aphorisms'', trans. R.J. Hollingdale, Middlesex: London, 1970, p. 154</ref> Analysts (e.g., Keith Ansell-Pearson) have suggested that Schopenhauer's advocacy of anti-[[egalitarianism]] and eugenics influenced the neo-aristocratic philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche, who initially considered Schopenhauer his mentor.<ref>''Nietzsche and modern German thought'' by K. Ansell-Pearson \u2013 1991 \u2013 Psychology Press.</ref>\n\n==== Animal welfare ====\nAs a consequence of his [[Monism|monistic]] philosophy, Schopenhauer was very concerned about the welfare of animals.<ref>Christina Gerhardt, \"Thinking With: Animals in Schopenhauer, Horkheimer and Adorno.\" Critical Theory and Animals. Ed. John Sanbonmatsu. Lanham: Rowland, 2011. 137\u2013157.</ref> For him, all individual animals, including humans, are essentially the same, being phenomenal manifestations of the one underlying Will. The word \"will\" designated, for him, force, power, impulse, energy, and desire; it is the closest word we have that can signify both the real essence of all external things and also our own direct, inner experience. Since every living thing possesses will, then humans and animals are fundamentally the same and can recognize themselves in each other.<ref>\"Unlike the intellect, it [the Will] does not depend on the perfection of the organism, but is essentially the same in all animals as what is known to us so intimately. Accordingly, the animal has all the emotions of humans, such as joy, grief, fear, anger, love, hatred, strong desire, envy, and so on. The great difference between human and animal rests solely on the intellect's degrees of perfection. ''On the Will in Nature'', \"Physiology and Pathology.\"</ref> For this reason, he claimed that a good person would have sympathy for animals, who are our fellow sufferers.\n\n<blockquote>Compassion for animals is intimately associated with goodness of character, and it may be confidently asserted that he who is cruel to living creatures cannot be a good man.<ref>''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19</ref></blockquote>\n<blockquote>Nothing leads more definitely to a recognition of the identity of the essential nature in animal and human phenomena than a study of zoology and anatomy.<ref>{{cite book | last = Schopenhauer | first = Arthur | title = Philosophical Writings | publisher = Continuum | location = London | year = 1994 | isbn = 978-0-8264-0729-0 |page=233}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>The assumption that animals are without rights and the illusion that our treatment of them has no moral significance is a positively outrageous example of Western crudity and barbarity. Universal compassion is the only guarantee of morality.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ryder | first = Richard | title = Animal Revolution: Changing Attitudes Towards Speciesism | publisher = Berg Publishers | location = Oxford | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-1-85973-330-1 |page=57}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 1841, he praised the establishment, in London, of the [[Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], and also the Animals' Friends Society in Philadelphia. Schopenhauer even went so far as to protest against the use of the pronoun \"it\" in reference to animals because it led to the treatment of them as though they were inanimate things.<ref>\"... in English all animals are of the neuter gender and so are represented by the pronoun 'it,' just as if they were inanimate things. The effect of this artifice is quite revolting, especially in the case of primates, such as dogs, monkeys, and the like....\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> To reinforce his points, Schopenhauer referred to anecdotal reports of the look in the eyes of a monkey who had been shot<ref>\"I recall having read of an Englishman who, while hunting in India, had shot a monkey; he could not forget the look which the dying animal gave him, and since then had never again fired at monkeys.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref> and also the grief of a baby elephant whose mother had been killed by a hunter.<ref>\"[Sir William Harris] describes how he shot his first elephant, a female. The next morning he went to look for the dead animal; all the other elephants had fled from the neighborhood except a young one, who had spent the night with its dead mother. Forgetting all fear, he came toward the sportsmen with the clearest and liveliest evidence of inconsolable grief, and put his tiny trunk round them in order to appeal to them for help. Harris says he was then filled with real remorse for what he had done, and felt as if he had committed a murder.\" ''[[On the basis of morality]]'', \u00a7 19.</ref>\n\nHe was very attached to his succession of pet poodles. Schopenhauer criticized [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza's]]<ref>\"His contempt for animals, who, as mere things for our use, are declared by him to be without rights,...in conjunction with Pantheism, is at the same time absurd and abominable.\" ''The World as Will and Representation'', Vol. 2, Chapter 50.</ref> belief that animals are to be used as a mere means for the satisfaction of humans.<ref>Spinoza, ''Ethics'', Pt. IV, Prop. XXXVII, Note I.: \"Still I do not deny that beasts feel: what I deny is, that we may not consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in a way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours....\" This is the exact opposite of Schopenhauer's doctrine. Also, ''ibid.'', Appendix, 26, \"whatsoever there be in nature beside man, a regard for our advantage does not call on us to preserve, but to preserve or destroy according to its various capacities, and to adapt to our use as best we may.\"</ref><ref>\"Such are the matters which I engage to prove in Prop. xviii of this Part, whereby it is plain that the law against the slaughtering of animals is founded rather on vain superstition and womanish pity than on sound reason. The rational quest of what is useful to us further teaches us the necessity of associating ourselves with our fellow-men, but not with beasts, or things, whose nature is different from our own; we have the same rights in respect to them as they have in respect to us. Nay, as everyone's right is defined by his virtue, or power, men have far greater rights over beasts than beasts have over men. Still I affirm that beasts feel. But I also affirm that we may consult our own advantage and use them as we please, treating them in the way which best suits us; for their nature is not like ours, and their emotions are naturally different from human emotions.\" ''Ethics'', Part 4, Prop. 37, Note 1.</ref>\n\n==== Views on homosexuality ====\nIn the third, expanded edition of ''The World as Will and Representation'' (1859), Schopenhauer added an appendix to his chapter on the ''Metaphysics of Sexual Love''. He also wrote that homosexuality did have the benefit of preventing ill-begotten children. Concerning this, he stated that \"the vice we are considering appears to work directly against the aims and ends of nature, and that in a matter that is all important and of the greatest concern to her it must in fact serve these very aims, although only indirectly, as a means for preventing greater evils.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=566}}</ref>\n\n==== Views on pederasty ====\nHe wrote that only those who were too old or too young to reproduce strong, healthy children would resort to pederasty (Schopenhauer considered pederasty in itself a [[vice]]).<ref>\"The World as Will and Representation: Volume Two\". Dover</ref> Shrewdly anticipating the interpretive distortion, on the part of the popular mind, of his attempted scientific ''explanation'' of [[pederasty]] as personal ''advocacy'' (when he had otherwise described the act, in terms of spiritual ethics, as an \"objectionable aberration\"), Schopenhauer sarcastically concludes the appendix with the statement that \"by expounding these paradoxical ideas, I wanted to grant to the professors of philosophy a small favour, for they are very disconcerted by the ever-increasing publicization of my philosophy which they so carefully concealed. I have done so by giving them the opportunity of slandering me by saying that I defend and commend pederasty.\"<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Schopenhauer|1969|p=567}}</ref>\n\n=== Intellectual interests and affinities ===\n\n==== [[Indology]] ====\nSchopenhauer read the Latin translation of the ancient [[Hindu]] texts, The [[Upanisad|Upanishads]], which French writer [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Anquetil du Perron]] had translated from the Persian translation of Prince [[Dara Shikoh]] entitled ''Sirre-Akbar'' (\"The Great Secret\"). He was so impressed by their philosophy that he called them \"the production of the highest human wisdom\", and believed they contained superhuman concepts. The Upanishads was a great source of inspiration to Schopenhauer. Writing about them, he said:\n\n<blockquote>It is the most satisfying and elevating reading (with the exception of the original text) which is possible in the world; it has been the solace of my life and will be the solace of my death.<ref>{{cite book|last=Clarke|first=John James|title=Oriental enlightenment|publisher=Routledge|year=1997|page=68|isbn=978-0-415-13376-0}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIt is well known that the book ''Oupnekhat'' (Upanishad) always lay open on his table, and he invariably studied it before sleeping at night. He called the opening up of Sanskrit literature \"the greatest gift of our century\", and predicted that the philosophy and knowledge of the Upanishads would become the cherished faith of the West.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.philosophy.ru/library/asiatica/indica/authors/motives.html|title=Western Indologists: A Study in Motives|last=Dutt|first=Purohit Bhagavan|accessdate=9 May 2009}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer was first introduced to the 1802 Latin Upanishad translation through Friedrich Majer. They met during the winter of 1813\u20131814 in [[Weimar]] at the home of Schopenhauer's mother according to the biographer Safranski. Majer was a follower of [[Johann Gottfried Herder|Herder]], and an early [[Indologist]]. Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of the Indic texts, however, until the summer of 1814. Sansfranski maintains that between 1815 and 1817, Schopenhauer had another important cross-pollination with Indian thought in [[Dresden]]. This was through his neighbor of two years, [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]]. Krause was then a minor and rather unorthodox philosopher who attempted to mix his own ideas with that of ancient Indian wisdom. Krause had also mastered [[Sanskrit]], unlike Schopenhauer, and the two developed a professional relationship. It was from Krause that Schopenhauer learned [[meditation]] and received the closest thing to expert advice concerning Indian thought.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3\u20134</ref>\n\nMost noticeable, in the case of Schopenhauer\u2019s work, was the significance of the [[Chandogya Upanishad]], whose [[Mahavakya]], [[Tat Tvam Asi]] is mentioned throughout ''The World as Will and Representation''.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 54\u201356</ref>\n\n==== Buddhism ====\nSchopenhauer noted a correspondence between his doctrines and the [[Four Noble Truths]] of [[Buddhism]].<ref>Abelson, Peter (April 1993).\n[http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-PHIL/peter2.htm Schopenhauer and Buddhism]. ''Philosophy East and West\nVolume 43, Number 2'', pp. 255\u2013278. University of Hawaii Press. Retrieved on: 12 April 2008.</ref> Similarities centered on the principles that life involves suffering, that suffering is caused by desire ([[ta\u1e47h\u0101]]), and that the extinction of desire leads to liberation. Thus three of the four \"truths of the Buddha\" correspond to Schopenhauer's doctrine of the will.<ref>[[Christopher Janaway|Janaway]], Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&nbsp;f.</ref> In Buddhism, however, while greed and lust are always unskillful, desire is ethically variable \u2013 it can be skillful, unskillful, or neutral.<ref name=\"David Burton 2004, page 22\">David Burton, \"Buddhism, Knowledge and Liberation: A Philosophical Study.\" Ashgate Publishing, Ltd., 2004, page 22.</ref>\n\nFor Schopenhauer, Will had [[ontology|ontological]] primacy over the [[intellect]]; in other words, desire is understood to be prior to thought. Schopenhauer felt this was similar to notions of [[puru\u1e63\u0101rtha]] or goals of life in [[Ved\u0101nta]] [[Hinduism]].\n\nIn Schopenhauer's philosophy, denial of the will is attained by either:\n* personal experience of an extremely great suffering that leads to loss of the will to live; or\n* knowledge of the essential nature of life in the world through observation of the suffering of other people.\n\nHowever, Buddhist [[nirv\u0101\u1e47a]] is not equivalent to the condition that Schopenhauer described as denial of the will. Nirv\u0101\u1e47a is not the extinguishing of the ''person'' as some Western scholars have thought, but only the \"extinguishing\" (the literal meaning of nirvana) of the flames of greed, hatred, and delusion that assail a person's character.<ref>John J. Holder, ''Early Buddhist Discourses.'' Hackett Publishing Company, 2006, page xx.</ref> Occult historian [[Joscelyn Godwin]] (1945\u2013 ) stated, \"It was Buddhism that inspired the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer, and, through him, attracted [[Richard Wagner]].<ref>Godwin, J: ''Arktos: The Polar Myth in Science, Symbolism, and Nazi Survival'', page 38.

That he was the first is surely true, but the claim that he was ''influenced'' by Indian thought needs some qualification. There is a remarkable correspondence, at least in broad terms, between some of the central Schopenhauerian doctrines and Buddhism: notably in the views that empirical existence is suffering, that suffering originates in desires, and that salvation can be attained by the extinction of desires. These three 'truths of the Buddha' are mirrored closely in the essential structure of the doctrine of the will (On this, see Dorothea W. Dauer, ''Schopenhauer as Transmitter of Buddhist Ideas''. Note also the discussion by Bryan Magee, ''The Philosophy of Schopenhauer'', pp. 14\u201315, 316\u201321). Janaway, Christopher, ''Self and World in Schopenhauer's Philosophy'', p. 28&nbsp;f.\n</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nIf I wished to take the results of my philosophy as the standard of truth, I should have to concede to Buddhism pre-eminence over the others. In any case, it must be a pleasure to me to see my doctrine in such close agreement with a religion that the majority of men on earth hold as their own, for this numbers far more followers than any other. And this agreement must be yet the more pleasing to me, inasmuch as ''in my philosophizing I have certainly not been under its influence'' [emphasis added]. For up till 1818, when my work appeared, there was to be found in Europe only a very few accounts of Buddhism.<ref>''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. 2, Ch. 17</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nBuddhist philosopher [[Nishitani Keiji]], however, sought to distance Buddhism from Schopenhauer.<ref>''Artistic detachment in Japan and the West: psychic distance in comparative aesthetics'' by S. Odin \u2013 2001 \u2013 University of Hawaii Press.</ref> While Schopenhauer's philosophy may sound rather mystical in such a summary, his [[methodology]] was resolutely [[empirical]], rather than speculative or transcendental:\n\n<blockquote>\nPhilosophy ... is a science, and as such has no articles of faith; accordingly, in it nothing can be assumed as existing except what is either positively given empirically, or demonstrated through indubitable conclusions.<ref>''Parerga & Paralipomena'', vol. I, p. 106., trans. E.F.J. Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAlso note:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis actual world of what is knowable, in which we are and which is in us, remains both the material and the limit of our consideration.<ref>''World as Will and Representation'', vol. I, p. 273, trans. E.F.J. Payne.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe argument that Buddhism affected Schopenhauer's philosophy more than any other [[Dharma|Dharmic]] faith loses more credence when viewed in light of the fact that Schopenhauer did not begin a serious study of Buddhism until after the publication of ''The World as Will and Representation'' in 1818.<ref>Christopher McCoy, 3</ref> Scholars have started to revise earlier views about Schopenhauer's discovery of Buddhism. Proof of early interest and influence, however, appears in Schopenhauer's 1815/16 notes (transcribed and translated by Urs App) about Buddhism. They are included in a recent case study that traces Schopenhauer's interest in Buddhism and documents its influence.<ref>\nApp, Urs [http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp200_schopenhauer.pdf Arthur Schopenhauer and China.

It will not sound to him strange, as to many others, much less disagreeable; for I might, if it did not sound conceited, contend that every one of the detached statements which constitute the Upanishads, may be deduced as a necessary result from the fundamental thoughts which I have to enunciate, though those deductions themselves are by no means to be found there.<ref>''The World as Will and Representation'' Preface to the first edition, p. xiii</ref></blockquote>\n\nAmong Schopenhauer's other influences were: [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]],<ref>{{cite book\n|last=Magee\n|first=Bryan\n|authorlink=Bryan Magee\n|title=The Philosophy of Schopenhauer\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cfMD0RSjnEwC&pg=PA265&lpg=PA265&dq=shakespeare+schopenhauer\n|publisher=Oxford University Press\n|year=1977\n|page=265\n|isbn=978-0-19-823723-5}}</ref> [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[John Locke]], [[Thomas Reid]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Matthias Claudius]], [[George Berkeley]], [[David Hume]], and [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]].<ref>Schopenhauer and the Cartesian Tradition.

Some commentators suggest that Schopenhauer claimed that the noumenon, or thing-in-itself, was the basis for Schopenhauer's concept of the [[will (philosophy)|will]]. Other commentators suggest that Schopenhauer considered [[will (philosophy)|will]] to be only a subset of the \"thing-in-itself\" class, namely that which we can most directly experience.<ref>Bryan Magee, ''Misunderstanding Schopenhauer'', [[Institute of Germanic and Romance Studies]], University of London, 1990, {{ISBN|978-0-85457-148-2}}</ref>\n\nSchopenhauer's identification of the Kantian ''noumenon'' (i.e., the actually existing entity) with what he termed \"will\" deserves some explanation. The noumenon was what Kant called the ''Ding an sich'' (the Thing in Itself), the reality that is the foundation of our [[sense|sensory]] and [[mind|mental]] representations of an external world. In Kantian terms, those sensory and mental representations are mere phenomena. Schopenhauer departed from Kant in his description of the relationship between the phenomenon and the noumenon. According to Kant, things-in-themselves ground the phenomenal representations in our minds; Schopenhauer, on the other hand, believed that phenomena and noumena are two different sides of the same coin. Noumena do not ''cause'' phenomena, but rather phenomena are simply the way by which our minds perceive the noumena, according to the [[principle of sufficient reason]]. This is explained more fully in Schopenhauer's doctoral thesis, ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'' (1813).\n\nSchopenhauer's second major departure from Kant's epistemology concerns the body. Kant's philosophy was formulated as a response to the radical [[philosophical skepticism]] of David Hume, who claimed that causality could not be observed empirically. Schopenhauer begins by arguing that Kant's demarcation between external objects, knowable only as phenomena, and the Thing in Itself of noumenon, contains a significant omission. There is, in fact, one physical object we know more intimately than we know any object of sense perception: our own body.\n\nWe know our [[human anatomy|human bodies]] have boundaries and occupy space, the same way other objects known only through our named senses do. Though we seldom think of our body as a physical object, we know even before reflection that it shares some of an object's properties. We understand that a watermelon cannot successfully occupy the same space as an oncoming truck; we know that if we tried to repeat the experiment with our own body, we would obtain similar results\u2014we know this even if we do not understand the [[physics]] involved.\n\nWe know that our consciousness inhabits a physical body, similar to other physical objects only known as phenomena. Yet our consciousness is not commensurate with our body. Most of us possess the power of voluntary motion. We usually are not aware of the breathing of our [[human lung|lungs]] or the beating of our [[human heart|heart]] unless somehow our attention is called to them. Our ability to control either is limited. Our [[kidney]]s command our attention on their schedule rather than one we choose. Few of us have any idea what our [[liver]] is doing right now, though this organ is as needful as lungs, heart, or kidneys. The conscious mind is the servant, not the master, of these and other organs. These organs have an agenda the conscious mind did not choose, and over which it has limited power.\n\nWhen Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with the desires, needs, and impulses in us that we name \"will\", what he is saying is that we participate in the reality of an otherwise unachievable world outside the mind through will. We cannot ''prove'' that our mental picture of an outside world corresponds with a reality by reasoning; through will, we know\u2014without thinking\u2014that the world can stimulate us. We suffer fear, or desire: these states arise involuntarily; they arise prior to reflection; they arise even when the conscious mind would prefer to hold them at bay. The rational mind is, for Schopenhauer, a leaf borne along in a stream of pre-reflective and largely unconscious emotion. That stream is will, and through will, if not through logic, we can participate in the underlying reality beyond mere phenomena. It is for this reason that Schopenhauer identifies the ''noumenon'' with what we call our will.\n\nIn his criticism of Kant, Schopenhauer claimed that sensation and understanding are separate and distinct abilities. Yet, for Kant, an object is known through each of them. Kant wrote: \"[T]here are two stems of human knowledge ... namely, sensibility and understanding, objects being given by the former [sensibility] and thought by the latter [understanding].\"<ref>''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', A 15</ref> Schopenhauer disagreed. He asserted that mere sense impressions, not objects, are given by sensibility. According to Schopenhauer, objects are intuitively perceived by understanding and are discursively thought by reason (Kant had claimed that (1) the understanding thinks objects through concepts and that (2) reason seeks the unconditioned or ultimate answer to \"why?\"). Schopenhauer said that Kant's mistake regarding perception resulted in all of the obscurity and difficult confusion that is exhibited in the Transcendental Analytic section of his critique.\n\nLastly, Schopenhauer departed from Kant in how he interpreted the [[Platonic forms|Platonic ideas]].  In ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' Schopenhauer explicitly stated:\n\n<blockquote>...Kant used the word [Idea] wrongly as well as illegitimately, although Plato had already taken possession of it, and used it most appropriately.</blockquote>\n\nInstead Schopenhauer relied upon the [[Neoplatonist]] interpretation of the biographer [[Diogenes La\u00ebrtius]] from ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''. In reference to Plato's Ideas, Schopenhauer quotes La\u00ebrtius verbatim in an explanatory footnote.\n\nDiogenes La\u00ebrtius (III, 12) Plato ideas in natura velut exemplaria dixit subsistere; cetera his esse similia, ad istarum similitudinem consistencia.\n(Plato teaches that the Ideas exist in nature, so to speak, as patterns or prototypes, and that the remainder of things only resemble them, and exist as their copies.)<ref>McCoy, Christopher Patrick. 2009.

Master's thesis, James Madison University: 10\u201313.</ref>\n\n=== Critique of Hegel ===\nSchopenhauer expressed his dislike for the philosophy of his contemporary [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] many times in his published works. The following quotations are typical:\n\n:If I were to say that the so-called philosophy of this fellow Hegel is a colossal piece of mystification which will yet provide posterity with an inexhaustible theme for laughter at our times, that it is a [[pseudophilosophy|pseudo-philosophy]] paralyzing all mental powers, stifling all real thinking, and, by the most outrageous misuse of language, putting in its place the hollowest, most senseless, thoughtless, and, as is confirmed by its success, most stupefying verbiage, I should be quite right.\n\n:Further, if I were to say that this summus philosophus ... scribbled nonsense quite unlike any mortal before him, so that whoever could read his most eulogized work, the so-called ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit|Phenomenology of the Mind]]'', without feeling as if he were in a madhouse, would qualify as an inmate for [[Bethlem Royal Hospital|Bedlam]], I should be no less right.<ref>[[On the Basis of Morality]], pp. 15\u201316.</ref>\n\n:At first Fichte and Schelling shine as the heroes of this epoch; to be followed by the man who is quite unworthy even of them, and greatly their inferior in point of talent\u2014I mean the stupid and clumsy charlatan Hegel.<ref>[[On the Basis of Morality]], p. 35.</ref>\n\nIn his Foreword to the first edition of his work ''Die beiden Grundprobleme der Ethik'', Schopenhauer suggested that he had shown Hegel to have fallen prey to the ''[[Post hoc ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.\n\nSchopenhauer suggested that Hegel's works were filled with \"castles of abstraction\", and that Hegel used deliberately impressive but ultimately vacuous verbiage.<ref name=\"orientalia.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.orientalia.org/wisdom/Philosophy/Pseudophilosophy.shtml |title=Philosophy: Pseudophilosophy |publisher=Orientalia.org |accessdate=12 March 2010}}</ref> He also thought that his glorification of church and state were designed for personal advantage and had little to do with the search for philosophical [[truth]].<ref name=\"orientalia.org\"/> For instance, the [[Right Hegelians]] interpreted Hegel as viewing the Prussian state of his day as perfect and the goal of all history up until then.<ref>\"... the Hegelians who, in complete unsmiling seriousness, were airing the question of what the further content of world history could possibly be, now that in the Hegelian philosophy the world spirit had reached the goal, the knowledge of itself.\" Safranski, p. 256.</ref>\n\n== Criticism of Schopenhauer's personal life ==\nThe British philosopher and historian [[Bertrand Russell]] deemed Schopenhauer an insincere person, because judging by his life:\n\n:\"He habitually dined well, at a good restaurant; he had many trivial love-affairs, which were sensual but not passionate; he was exceedingly quarrelsome and unusually avaricious. ... It is hard to find in his life evidences of any virtue except kindness to animals ... In all other respects he was completely selfish. It is difficult to believe that a man who was profoundly convinced of the virtue of [[asceticism]] and resignation would never have made any attempt to embody his convictions in his practice.\"<ref name=Insincere>{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Bertrand|title=HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY|year=1946|publisher=George Allen and Unwin LTD|location=Start of 2nd paragraph|pages=786}}</ref>\n\n[[Bryan Magee]] argues that \"the answer to such shallow, but not uncommon criticism\" is found in a quotation from Schopenhauer:\n:\"It is therefore just as little necessary for the saint to be a philosopher as for the philosopher to be a saint; just as it is not necessary for a perfectly beautiful person to be a great sculptor, or for a great sculptor to be himself a beautiful person. In general, it is a strange demand on a moralist that he should commend no other virtue than that which he himself possesses. To repeat abstractly, universally, and distinctly in concepts the whole inner nature of the world, and thus to deposit it as a reflected image in permanent concepts always ready for the faculty of reason, this and nothing else is philosophy.\"<ref>The Philosophy of Schopenhauer, Oxford University Press, pg 211</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[File:Arthur Schopenhauer by Wilhelm Busch.jpeg|thumb|upright|Caricature of Schopenhauer by [[Wilhelm Busch]] (1832\u20131908)]]\n\nSchopenhauer has had a massive influence upon later thinkers, though more so in the [[arts]] (especially literature and music) and [[psychology]] than in philosophy. His popularity peaked in the early twentieth century, especially during the [[Modernist]] era, and waned somewhat thereafter. Nevertheless, a number of recent publications have reinterpreted and modernised the study of Schopenhauer. His theory is also being explored by some modern philosophers as a precursor to [[evolutionary theory]] and modern evolutionary psychology.<ref>In the book ''Straw Dogs'', John Gray upheld Schopenhauer as one of the few philosophers who has dedicated himself to studying Eastern philosophy as well as Western philosophy. The book argues against free will, and states that humans have much more in common with animals than is commonly admitted in the West. Schopenhauer is praised for his attitude towards animals, and for having addressed the brutality of much of human life.</ref>\n\nRussian writer and philosopher [[Leo Tolstoy]] was greatly influenced by Schopenhauer. After reading Schopenhauer's ''The World as Will and Representation'', Tolstoy gradually became converted to the ascetic morality upheld in that work as the proper spiritual path for the upper classes: \"Do you know what this summer has meant for me? Constant raptures over Schopenhauer and a whole series of spiritual delights which I've never experienced before. ... no student has ever studied so much on his course, and learned so much, as I have this summer\"<ref>Tolstoy's Letter to A.A. Fet, August 30, 1869</ref>\n\n[[Richard Wagner]], writing in his autobiography, remembered his first impression that Schopenhauer left on him (when he read ''World as Will and Representation''):\n:Schopenhauer\u2019s book was never completely out of my mind, and by the following summer I had studied it from cover to cover four times. It had a radical influence on my whole life.<ref>Kimball, Roger. Schopenhauer's world. The New Criterion, 1985</ref>\n\nWagner also commented on that \"serious mood, which was trying to find ecstatic expression\" created by Schopenhauer inspired the conception of Tristan und Isolde.<ref>{{Cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=2OUsAAAAYAAJ&vq=%22It+was+some+such+mood+that+inspired+the+conception+of+a+Tristan+und+Isolde.%22&pg=PA617&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&f=false|title= My life}}</ref> See also [[Tristan und Isolde#Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde|Influence of Schopenhauer on Tristan und Isolde]].\n\n{{Css Image Crop|Image = DAN-28a-Danzig-500MIL Mark (1923).jpg|bSize = 235|cWidth = 235|cHeight = 133|oTop = 2|oLeft = 0|Location = right|Description= Schopenhauer depicted on a 500 million Danzig [[German Papiermark#German Papiermark of Danzig|papiermark]] note (1923).}}\n\n[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] owed the awakening of his philosophical interest to reading ''The World as Will and Representation'' and admitted that he was one of the few philosophers that he respected, dedicating to him his essay ''Schopenhauer als Erzieher''<ref>[[s:Schopenhauer as Educator|Schopenhauer as Educator]]</ref> one of his ''[[Untimely Meditations]]''.\n\n[[Jorge Luis Borges]] remarked that the reason he had never attempted to write a systematic account of his world view, despite his penchant for philosophy and metaphysics in particular, was because Schopenhauer had already written it for him.{{sfn|Magee|1997|p=413}}\n\nAs a teenager, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] adopted Schopenhauer's epistemological idealism. However, after his study of the philosophy of mathematics, he rejected epistemological idealism for [[Gottlob Frege]]'s conceptual realism. In later years, Wittgenstein was highly dismissive of Schopenhauer, describing him as an ultimately shallow thinker: \"Schopenhauer has quite a crude mind... where real depth starts, his comes to an end.\"<ref name=\"Culture & Value, p.24, 1933\u20134\"/><ref>Malcolm, Norman.

[[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu]] and [[Umbundu]]: ''Repubilika ya Ngola''), is a [[country]] in [[Southern Africa]]. It is the [[List of African countries by area|seventh-largest]] country in [[Africa]] and is bordered by [[Namibia]] to the south, the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] to the north, [[Zambia]] to the east, and the [[Atlantic Ocean]] to west. The [[exclave]] province of [[Cabinda Province|Cabinda]] has borders with the [[Republic of the Congo]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The capital and largest city of Angola is [[Luanda]].\n\nAlthough its territory has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Era]], what is now the modern country of Angola was influenced by [[Portuguese colonization of Africa|Portuguese colonisation]], which began with, and was for centuries limited to, coastal settlements and trading posts established beginning in the 16th century. In the 19th century, European settlers slowly and hesitantly began to establish themselves in the interior. As a [[Portuguese West Africa|Portuguese colony]], Angola did not encompass its present borders until the early 20th century, following resistance by groups such as the [[Cuamato]], the [[Oukwanyama|Kwanyama]] and the [[Mbunda people|Mbunda]]. Independence was achieved in 1975 under a [[People's Republic of Angola|Marxist-Leninist one party state]], backed by the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Cuba]] after a protracted [[Angolan War of Independence|anti-colonial struggle]]. However, the country soon descended into an even lengthier [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] that lasted until 2002. It has since become a relatively stable [[Unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential republic]].\n\nAngola has vast [[Mineral reserve|mineral]] and [[petroleum reserves]], and its economy is among the fastest growing in the world, especially since the cessation of the civil war. In spite of this, the standard of living remains low for the majority of the population, and [[life expectancy]]  in Angola is among the lowest in the world, while [[infant mortality|infant mortality rates]] are among the highest.<ref>{{cite web|title=Life expectancy at birth|year=2014|work=World Fact Book|publisher=United States Central Intelligence Agency|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2102rank.html}}</ref> Angola's economic growth is highly uneven, with the majority of the nation's [[wealth concentration|wealth concentrated]] in a disproportionately small sector of the population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2010/04/13/transparency-and-accountability-angola|title=Transparency and Accountability in Angola|website=Human Rights Watch|access-date=1 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAngola is a member state of the [[United Nations]], [[OPEC]], [[African Union]], the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]], and the [[Southern African Development Community]]. A highly multiethnic country, Angola's 25.8 million people span various tribal groups, customs, and traditions. Angolan culture reflects centuries of Portuguese rule, namely in the predominance of the [[Portuguese language]] and the [[Catholic Church]], combined with diverse indigenous influences.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name ''Angola'' comes from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] colonial name ''[[Angola (Portugal)|Reino de Angola]] (Kingdom of Angola)'', appearing as early as [[Dias de Novais]]'s 1571 charter.<ref>Heywood, Linda M. & Thornton, John K.

Life for European colonists was difficult and progress proved to be slow. [[John Iliffe (historian)|Iliffe]] notes that \"Portuguese records of Angola from the 16th century show that a great [[famine]] occurred on average every seventy years; accompanied by epidemic disease, it might kill one-third or one-half of the population, destroying the demographic growth of a generation and forcing colonists back into the river valleys\".<ref>Iliffe, John (2007) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bNGN2URP_rUC&pg=&dq&hl=en#v=onepage&q=&f=false ''Africans: the history of a continent''].

The conquest of [[Pungo Andongo]] in 1671 was the last major Portuguese expansion from Luanda, as attempts to invade Kongo in 1670 and Matamba in 1681 failed.

Cabinda borders the [[Congo Republic]] to the north and north-northeast and the DRC to the east and south. The town of Cabinda is the chief population centre.\n\nAccording to a 1995 census, Cabinda had an estimated population of 600,000, approximately 400,000 of whom live in neighbouring countries. Population estimates are, however, highly unreliable. Consisting largely of tropical forest, Cabinda produces hardwoods, coffee, cocoa, crude rubber and palm oil. The product for which it is best known, however, is its oil, which has given it the nickname, \"the Kuwait of Africa\". Cabinda's petroleum production from its considerable offshore reserves now accounts for more than half of Angola's output.<ref>{{cite news|title=Angola profile|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13036732 | publisher=BBC News | date=22 December 2013}}</ref> Most of the oil along its coast was discovered under [[Portuguese Angola|Portuguese rule]] by the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company (CABGOC) from 1968 onwards.\n\nEver since [[Portugal]] handed over sovereignty of its former overseas province of Angola to the local independence groups (MPLA, UNITA and FNLA), the territory of Cabinda has been a focus of separatist guerrilla actions opposing the [[Government of Angola]] (which has employed its armed forces, the FAA\u2014For\u00e7as Armadas Angolanas) and Cabindan separatists. The [[Front for the Liberation of the Enclave of Cabinda]]-[[For\u00e7as Armadas de Cabinda|Armed Forces of Cabinda]] (FLEC-FAC) announced a virtual Federal Republic of Cabinda under the Presidency of N'Zita Henriques Tiago.

Since independence, oil and diamonds have been the most important economic resource. Smallholder and plantation agriculture have dramatically dropped because of the [[Angolan Civil War]], but have begun to recover after 2002. The transformation industry that had come into existence in the late colonial period collapsed at independence, because of the exodus of most of the ethnic Portuguese population, but has begun to reemerge with updated technologies, partly because of the influx of new Portuguese entrepreneurs. Similar developments can be verified in the service sector.\n\nOverall, Angola's economy has in recent years moved on from the disarray caused by a quarter-century of civil war to become the fastest-growing economy in Africa and one of the fastest in the world, with an average GDP growth of 20 percent between 2005 and 2007.<ref>[http://www.mfw4a.org/angola/angola-financial-sector-profile.html Angola Financial Sector Profile: MFW4A \u2013 Making Finance Work for Africa].

While a reasonable road infrastructure has existed within Angola, time and the war have taken their toll on the road surfaces, leaving many severely potholed, littered with broken asphalt. In many areas drivers have established alternate tracks to avoid the worst parts of the surface, although careful attention must be paid to the presence or absence of landmine warning markers by the side of the road. The Angolan government has contracted the restoration of many of the country's roads. The road between Lubango and Namibe, for example, was completed recently with funding from the European Union, and is comparable to many European main routes. Completing the road infrastructure is likely to take some decades, but substantial efforts are already being made.\n\nTransport is an important aspect in Angola because it is strategically located and it could become a regional logistics hub. In addition Angola has some of the most important and biggest ports and so it is vital to connect them to the interior of the country as well as to neighbouring countries.\n\nTourism is creaking to its feet on the heels of the long ended stop in the civil war, and very few tourists venture anywhere in Angola yet due to lack of infrastructure.\n\n===Telecommunications===\nThe [[telecommunication]]s industry is considered one of the main strategic sectors in Angola.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anip.co.ao/index.php?pag=conteudos&id=6 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130411062215/http://www.anip.co.ao/index.php?pag=conteudos&id=6 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=11 April 2013 |title=Sectores Econ\u00f3micos Priorit\u00e1rios |publisher=ANIP |language=Portuguese }}</ref>\n\nIn October 2014, the building of an [[optic fiber]] underwater cable was announced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/pt_pt/noticias/economia/2014/9/42/Angola-Cables-parceiros-estrangeiros-anunciam-construcao-cabo-submarino,db62f448-710d-4cc5-80c5-fcee32a1a991.html|title=Angola Cables e parceiros estrangeiros anunciam constru\u00e7\u00e3o de cabo submarino|date=14 October 2014|publisher=ANGOP|language=Portuguese}}</ref> This project aims to turn Angola into a continental hub, thus improving Internet connections both nationally and internationally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/sociedade/tecnologia/cabo-submarino-que-ligara-brasil-africa-tera-capacidade-de-40-terabits-por-segundo-11456022|title=Cabo submarino que ligar\u00e1 Brasil \u00e0 \u00c1frica ter\u00e1 capacidade de 40 terabits por segundo|author=Machado, Andr\u00e9 |date=30 January 2014|publisher=O Globo|language=Portuguese}}</ref>\n\nOn 11 March 2015, the First Angolan Forum of Telecommunications and Information Technology was held in [[Luanda]] under the motto \"The challenges of telecommunications in the current context of Angola\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jornaldeangola.sapo.ao/politica/nacao_esta_mais_ligada|title=Na\u00e7\u00e3o est\u00e1 mais ligada|author=In\u00e1cio, Adelina |date=12 March 2015|publisher=Jornal de Angola|language=Portuguese}}</ref> The purpose of this forum was to promote the debate on topical issues on telecommunications in Angola and worldwide.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/angola/en_us/noticias/economia/2015/2/11/Angola-has-about-million-mobile-phone-network-users-Minister,2053f698-ce71-4ed2-9910-cd5819ad539d.html|title=Angola has about 14 million mobile phone network users \u2013 Minister|date=12 March 2015|publisher=ANGOP}}</ref> A study about this sector was also presented at this forum, and some of its conclusions were: Angola had the first telecommunications operator in Africa to test the High Speed Internet technology (LTE-Advanced with speeds up to 400Mbit/s);

In this urban culture, the Portuguese heritage has become more and more dominant. African roots are evident in music and dance, and is moulding the way in which Portuguese is spoken. This process is well reflected in contemporary Angolan literature, especially in the works of [[Angolan literature|Angolan authors]].\n\nIn 2014, Angola resumed the National Festival of Angolan Culture after a 25-year break.

There are food and waterborne diseases, bacterial and protozoal diarrhea, hepatitis A, and typhoid fever; vectorborne diseases, malaria, African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness); respiratory disease: meningococcal meningitis, and schistosomiasis, a water contact disease, as of 2005.\n\n===Ethnic groups===\n[[File:Angola Ethnic map 1970.svg|thumb|right|300px|Ethnic groups of Angola 1970]]\nRoughly 37% of Angolans are [[Ovimbundu]], 25% are [[Northern Mbundu people|Ambundu]], 13% are [[Bakongo]], 2% are [[mesti\u00e7o]], 1-2% are [[White Africans of European ancestry|white Africans]], and people from other African ethnicities make up 22% of Angola's population.\n\n===Religions===\n{{Main article|Religion in Angola}}\nAngola is a majority Christian country. Official statistics don't exist, but it is estimated that over 80% belong to a Christian church or community. More than half are [[Catholic Church|Catholic]], the remaining ones comprising members of traditional [[Protestant]] churches as well as of [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] communities. Only 1 - 2% are [[Muslim]]s  - generally immigrants from other African countries. Traditional indigenous religions are practized by a very small minority, generally in peripheral rural societies.\n\n===Education===\n{{Main article|Education in Angola}}\nLiteracy is quite low, with 67.4% of the population over the age of 15 able to read and write in Portuguese. 82.9% of males and 54.2% of women are literate as of 2001.\n\n===Languages===\n{{Main article|Languages of Angola}}\n[[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of Angola, but [[Bantu language|Bantu]] and other African languages are also widely spoken. In fact, [[Kikongo]], [[Kimbundu languages|Kimbundu]], [[Umbundu]], [[Chokwe language|Tuchokwe]], [[Ganguela|Nganguela]], and [[Kwanyama dialect|Ukanyama]] have the official status of \"national languages\". The mastery of Portuguese is widespread; in the cities the overwhelming majority are either fluent in Portuguese or have at least a reasonable working knowledge of this language; an increasing minority are native Portuguese speakers and have a poor, if any, knowledge of an African language.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{CIA World Factbook|year=2007}}\n*{{StateDept}} 2003\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Demographics of Angola}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20091005014319/http://www.worldmapper.org/countrycartograms/carto_ago.htm Population cartogram of Angola]\n\n{{Ethnic groups in Angola}}\n{{Africa in topic|Demographics of}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Demographics Of Angola}}\n[[Category:Angolan society]]\n[[Category:Demographics by country|Angola]]\n[[Category:Demographics of Africa|Angola]]", "sha1": "se8l78hxk3caen62wqz1tkupbo8aowx"}}, {"title": "Politics of Angola", "ns": "0", "id": "705", "revision": {"id": "789919189", "parentid": "753412356", "timestamp": "2017-07-10T13:22:39Z", "contributor": {"username": "Ecangola", "id": "31439127"}, "model": "wikitext", "format": "text/x-wiki", "text": "{{Politics of Angola}}\nSince the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Angola#2010 constitution|constitution in 2010]], the '''politics of Angola''' takes place in a framework of a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[republic]], whereby the [[President of Angola]] is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]], and of a [[multi-party system]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in the President, the [[Forms of government|government]] and parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly approves Angolan Constitution|url=http://www.portalangop.co.ao/motix/en_us/noticias/politica/2010/0/3/Constituent-Assembly-approves-Angolan-Constitution,7c03e88b-4d2c-425f-bacd-caf923937062.html|website=Angola Press|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Angola]] changed from a [[One-party state|one-party]] [[Marxist]]-[[Leninist]] system ruled by the [[Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] (MPLA), in place since independence in 1975, to a multiparty democracy based on a new constitution adopted in 1992.  That same year the first parliamentary and presidential elections were held. The MPLA won an absolute majority in the parliamentary elections. In the presidential elections, President [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]] won the first round election with more than 49% of the vote to [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s 40%. A runoff election would have been necessary, but never took place. The renewal of civil war immediately after the elections, which were considered as fraudulent by UNITA, and the collapse of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], created a split situation. To a certain degree the new democratic institutions worked, notably the [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]], with the active participation of UNITA's and the FNLA's elected MPs  - while Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos continued to exercise his functions without democratic legitimation. However the armed forces of the MPLA (now the official armed forces of the Angolan state) and of UNITA fought each other until the leader of UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, was killed in action in 2002.<ref>From 1998 to 2002, there existed even a Government of National Unity and Reconciliation which included ministers from both FNLA and UNITA.</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 to 2010, the system as defined by the [[Constitution of Angola#1992 constitution|constitution of 1992]] functioned in a relatively normal way. The executive branch of the government was composed of the President, the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers. The Council of Ministers, composed of all ministers and vice ministers, met regularly to discuss policy issues. Governors of the 18 provinces were appointed by and served at the pleasure of the president.<ref>{{cite web|title=Angola: Constitution of 1992|url=http://www.content.eisa.org.za/old-page/angola-constitution-1992|website=Electoral Institute for Sustainable Democracy in Africa|accessdate=4 July 2015}}</ref> The Constitutional Law of 1992 established the broad outlines of government structure and the rights and duties of citizens. The legal system was based on Portuguese and customary law but was weak and fragmented. Courts operated in only 12 of more than 140 municipalities. A Supreme Court served as the appellate tribunal; a Constitutional Court with powers of judicial review was never constituted despite statutory authorization. In practice,  power was more and more concentrated in the hands of the President who, supported by an ever-increasing staff, largely controlled parliament, government, and the judiciary.<ref>http://www.bertensmann-transformation-index.de/bti/laendergutachten/laendergutachten/oestliches-und-suedliches-afrika/angola</ref>\n\nThe 26-year-long civil war has ravaged the country's political and social institutions. The UN estimates of 1.8 million [[internally displaced person]]s (IDPs), while generally the accepted figure for war-affected people is 4 million. Daily conditions of life throughout the country and specifically [[Luanda]] (population approximately 6 million) mirror the collapse of administrative infrastructure as well as many social institutions. The ongoing grave economic situation largely prevents any government support for social institutions. Hospitals are without medicines or basic equipment, schools are without books, and public employees often lack the basic supplies for their day-to-day work.\n\n==Executive branch==\nThe 2010 constitution grants the President almost absolute power. Elections for the National assembly are to take place every five years, and the President is automatically the leader of the winning party or coalition. It is for the President to appoint (and dismiss) all of the following:\n* The members of the government (state ministers, ministers, state secretaries and vice-ministers);\n* The members of the Constitutional Court;\n* The members of the Supreme Court;\n* The members of the Court of Auditors;\n* The members of the Military Supreme Court;\n* The Governor and Vice-Governors of the Nacional Angolan Bank;\n* The General-Attorney, the Vice-General-Attorneys and their deputies (as well as the military homologous);\n* The Governors of the provinces;\n* The members of the Republic Council;\n* The members of the National Security Council;\n* The members of the Superior Magistrates Councils;\n* The General Chief of the Armed Forces and his deputy;\n* All other command posts in the military;\n* The Police General Commander, and the 2nd in command;\n* All other command posts in the police;\n* The chiefs and directors of the intelligence and security organs.\nThe President is also provided a variety of powers, like defining the policy of the country. Even though it's not up to him/her to make laws (only to promulgate them and make edicts), the President is the leader of the winning party.\nThe only \"relevant\" post that is not directly appointed by the President is the Vice-President, which is the second in the winning party.<ref>http://www.angolaembassy.org.il/documents/AngolaConstitution05.02.2010.pdf</ref>\n\n==Legislative branch==\nThe [[National Assembly of Angola|National Assembly]] (''Assembleia Nacional'') has 223 members, elected for a four-year term, 130 members by [[proportional representation]], 90 members in provincial districts, and 3 members to represent Angolans abroad. The next general elections, due for 1997, have been rescheduled for 5 September 2008. The ruling party MPLA won 82% (191 seats in the National Assembly) and the main opposition party won only 10% (16 seats). The elections however have been described as only partly free but certainly not fair.<ref>http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2008/dokument_id-15323/index.html</ref> A White Book on the elections in 2008 lists up all irregularities surrounding the Parliamentary elections of 2008.<ref>http://www.kas.de/proj/home/pub/8/2/year-2009/dokument_id-17396/index.html</ref>\n\n==Political parties and elections==\n{{elect|List of political parties in Angola|Elections in Angola}}\n\n==Judicial branch==\nSupreme Court (or \"Tribunal da Relacao\") judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the president.

Despite extensive [[Crude oil|oil and gas]] resources, [[diamond]]s, [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] potential, and rich [[Agriculture|agricultural]] land, Angola remains poor, and a third of the population relies on subsistence agriculture. Since 2002, when the 27-year civil war ended, the nation has worked to repair and improve ravaged infrastructure and weakened political and social institutions. High international oil prices and rising oil production have contributed to the very strong economic growth since 1998,<ref>[[Google Public Data]]. Retrieved 2013-8-14.</ref> but corruption and public-sector mismanagement remain, particularly in the oil sector, which accounts for over 50 percent of GDP, over 90 percent of export revenue, and over 80 percent of government revenue.\n\n==History==\nThe [[Portuguese exploration of Africa|Portuguese explorer]] [[Diogo C\u00e3o]] reached the Angolan coast in 1484,<ref>{{cite EB9|ref=harv |wstitle=Angola |volume=2  |page=45 }}</ref> after which [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] began to found trading posts and forts along the shore. [[Paulo Dias de Novais]] founded S\u0101o Paulo de Loanda ([[Luanda]]) in 1575. S\u00e3o Felipe de Benguella ([[Benguela]]) followed in 1587.\n\nThe principal early trade was in [[Atlantic slave trade|slaves]]. Portuguese merchants purchased the slaves from the local [[Imbangala]] and [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]] peoples, [[Slavery in Africa|notable slave hunters]], and sold them to the [[sugarcane]] [[Sugar plantations in the Caribbean|plantation]]s in [[Captaincies of Brazil|Brazil]]. Brazilian ships were frequent visitors to Luanda and Benguela and Angola functioned as a kind of colony of Brazil, with Brazilian [[Jesuits]] active in its religious and educational centers.\n\nThe [[Portuguese Empire]] was neglected during the period of the [[Iberian Union]], which lasted from 1580 to 1640. The [[Netherlands|Dutch]], bitter enemies of their former masters in [[Kingdom of Spain|Spain]], invaded many Portuguese overseas possessions. During Portugal's separatist war against Spain, the Dutch occupied Luanda from 1640 to 1648, calling it \"Fort Aardenburgh\". The Dutch used the territory to supply their own slaves to the sugarcane plantations of [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern Brazil]] ([[Pernambuco]], [[Olinda]], [[Recife]]), which they had also seized from Portugal. [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], conquered the Portuguese possessions of [[Elmina|Saint George del Mina]], Saint Thomas, and Luanda, Angola, on the west coast of Africa. Portugal recovered the territory between 1648 and 1650.\n\nIn the high plains, the Planalto, the most important native states were [[Bi\u00e9 Province|Bi\u00e9]] and [[Bailundo]], the latter being noted for its production of foodstuffs and rubber. Portugal expanded into their territory,{{when|date=June 2015}} but did not control much of the interior prior to the late 19th century.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}}\n\nThe Portuguese started to develop townships, trading posts, logging camps and small processing factories. From 1764 onwards,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} there was a gradual change from a slave-based society to one based on production for domestic consumption and export. Following the [[independence of Brazil]] in 1822, the slave trade was formally abolished in 1836. However it did continue locally into the 20th century. In 1844, Angola's ports were opened to foreign shipping.\n\nBy 1850, Luanda was one of the greatest and most developed Portuguese cities in the vast [[Portuguese Empire]] outside of [[Mainland Portugal]],{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} full of trading companies,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} exporting peanut oil,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} copal,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} timber,{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} and cocoa.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The principal exports of the post-slave economy in the 19th century were [[rubber]], beeswax, and ivory.{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} Maize, tobacco, dried meat and [[cassava]] flour also began to be locally produced.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Prior to the [[First World War]], exportation of [[coffee]], [[palm tree|palm]] kernels and [[palm oil|oil]], [[cattle]], [[leather]] and [[Hide (skin)|hides]], and [[salt fish]] joined the principal exports, with small quantities of gold and [[cotton]] also being produced.<ref>{{cite EB1911|ref=harv |wstitle=Angola |volume=2 |page=39}}</ref> Grains, sugar, and rum were also produced for local consumption.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} The principal imports were foodstuffs, cotton goods, hardware, and British coal.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=39}} Legislation against foreign traders was implemented in the 1890s. The territory's prosperity, however, continued to depend on plantations worked by labor \"indentured\" from the interior.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=40}}\n\nFrom the 1920s to the 1960s, strong economic growth, abundant natural resources and development of infrastructure, led to the arrival of even more Portuguese settlers.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} [[Petroleum]] was known to exist as early as the mid-19th century,{{sfn|Baynes|1878|p=45}} but modern exploitation didn't begin until in 1955. Production began in the [[Cuanza basin]] in the 1950s, in the [[Congo basin]] in the 1960s, and in the [[exclave]] of [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]] in 1968. The [[Portuguese government]] granted operating rights for Block Zero to the Cabinda Gulf Oil Company, a subsidiary of [[ChevronTexaco]], in 1955.<ref name=\"opec\"/> Oil production surpassed the exportation of [[coffee]] as Angola's largest export in 1973.\n\n{|class=wikitable\n|-\n!colspan=3|Angolan oil production rates\n|-\n!Year\n!thousand barrels per day\n!thousand cubic metres per day\n|-\n|1974\n|{{convert|172|oilbbl|0|disp=table}}\n|-\n|1991\n|{{convert|490|oilbbl|0|disp=table}}\n|-\n|1995<ref name=\"oilhistory\">Tvedten, Inge.

[[Mobutu Sese Seko]], the [[President of Zaire]], met with [[Ant\u00f3nio de Sp\u00ednola]], the transitional [[President of Portugal]], on September 15, 1974, on [[Sal island]] in [[Cape Verde]], crafting a plan to empower [[Holden Roberto]] of the [[National Liberation Front of Angola]], [[Jonas Savimbi]] of [[UNITA]], and [[Daniel Chipenda]] of the [[MPLA]]'s eastern faction at the expense of MPLA leader [[Agostinho Neto]] while retaining the fa\u00e7ade of national unity. Mobutu and Sp\u00ednola wanted to present Chipenda as the MPLA head, Mobutu particularly preferring Chipenda over Neto because Chipenda supported autonomy for [[Cabinda (province)|Cabinda]]. The Angolan [[exclave]] has immense petroleum reserves estimated at around 300 million tons (~300{{e|9}}&nbsp;kg) which Zaire, and thus the Mobutu government, depended on for economic survival.<ref name=\"petroleum\">Erik P.

There was an immediate crisis because the indigenous African population lacked the skills and knowledge needed to run the country and maintain its well-developed infrastructure.\n\nThe Angolan government created [[Sonangol]], a state-run oil company, in 1976. Two years later Sonangol received the rights to oil exploration and production in all of Angola.<ref name=\"opec\">{{cite web |url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Angola/pdf.pdf |format=PDF |title=Angola |work= Energy Information Administration |publisher=Eia.doe.gov}}</ref> After independence from Portugal in 1975, Angola was ravaged by a horrific [[Angolan Civil War|civil war]] between 1975 and 2002.\n\n===1990s===\n[[United Nations Angola Verification Mission III]] and [[MONUA]] spent [[USD]]1.5 billion overseeing implementation of the [[Lusaka Protocol]], a 1994 peace accord that ultimately failed to end the civil war. The protocol prohibited [[UNITA]] from buying foreign arms, a provision the [[United Nations]] largely did not enforce, so both sides continued to build up their stockpile. UNITA purchased weapons in 1996 and 1997 from private sources in [[Albania]] and [[Bulgaria]], and from [[Zaire]], [[South Africa]], [[Republic of the Congo]], [[Zambia]], [[Togo]], and [[Burkina Faso]]. In October 1997 the UN imposed travel sanctions on UNITA leaders, but the UN waited until July 1998 to limit UNITA's exportation of diamonds and freeze UNITA bank accounts. While the U.S. government gave USD250 million to UNITA between 1986 and 1991, UNITA made USD1.72 billion between 1994 and 1999 exporting diamonds, primarily through Zaire to Europe. At the same time the Angolan government received large amounts of weapons from the governments of [[Belarus]], [[Brazil]], Bulgaria, [[China]], and [[South Africa]]. While no arms shipment to the government violated the protocol, no country informed the U.N. Register on Conventional Weapons as required.<ref name=\"lusaka\">Vines, Alex.

The program formally lapsed in June 2001, but the IMF remains engaged. In this context the Government of Angola has succeeded in unifying exchange rates and has raised fuel, electricity, and water rates. The Commercial Code, telecommunications law, and Foreign Investment Code are being modernized. A privatization effort, prepared with [[World Bank]] assistance, has begun with the [[Banco de Com\u00e9rcio e Ind\u00fastria|BCI]] bank.

Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 85% of the population. Oil production and the supporting activities are vital to the economy, contributing about 45% to GDP and 90% of exports. Growth is almost entirely driven by rising oil production which surpassed {{convert|1.4|Moilbbl/d}} in late-2005 and which is expected to grow to {{convert|2|Moilbbl/d}} by 2007.

Severe wartime conditions, including extensive planting of landmines throughout the countryside, have brought agricultural activities to a near-standstill. Some efforts to recover have gone forward, however, notably in fisheries. [[Coffee]] production, though a fraction of its pre-1975 level, is sufficient for domestic needs and some exports. Expanding oil production is now almost half of GDP and 90% of exports, at {{convert|800|koilbbl/d}}.

As part of the peace agreement, troops from both armies were to be [[demilitarized]] and then integrated. Integration was never completed as UNITA and FALA went back to war in 1992. Later, consequences for FALA personnel in Luanda were harsh with FAPLA veterans persecuting their erstwhile opponents in certain areas and reports of [[vigilantism]].\n\n== Army ==\n[[File:Angolan soldiers training in Russia.png|300px|right|thumb|Angolan Second Lieutenant, First Lieutenant, and Captain training in Russia in August 2015]]\n\n===General description===\nThe Army (''Ex\u00e9rcito'') is the land component of the FAA. It is organized in six military regions (Cabinda, Luanda, North, Center, East and South), with an infantry division being based in each one. Distributed by the six military regions / infantry divisions, there are 25 motorized infantry brigades, one tank brigade and one engineering brigade. The Army also includes an artillery regiment, the Military Artillery School, the Army Military Academy, an anti-aircraft defense group, a composite land artillery group, a military police regiment, a logistical transportation regiment and a field artillery brigade. The Army further includes the Special Forces Brigade (including Commandos and Special Operations units), but this unit is under the direct command of the General Staff of the FAA.\n\n===History===\nOn August 1, 1974 a few months after a military [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] had overthrown the [[Lisbon]] regime and proclaimed its intention of granting independence to Angola, the MPLA announced the formation of FAPLA, which replaced the EPLA. By 1976 FAPLA had been transformed from lightly armed guerrilla units into a national [[army]] capable of sustained field operations.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]</ref>\n\nIn 1990-91, the Army had ten military regions and an estimated 73+ 'brigades', each with a mean strength of 1,000 and comprising inf, tank, APC, artillery, and AA units as required.<ref>IISS Military Balance 1990 or 1991</ref> The [[Library of Congress]] said in 1990 that '[t]he regular army's 91,500 troops were organized into more than seventy brigades ranging from 750 to 1,200 men each and deployed throughout the ten military regions. Most regions were commanded by lieutenant colonels, with majors as deputy commanders, but some regions were commanded by majors. Each region consisted of one to four provinces, with one or more infantry brigades assigned to it. The brigades were generally dispersed in battalion or smaller unit formations to protect strategic terrain, urban centers, settlements, and critical infrastructure such as bridges and factories. Counterintelligence agents were assigned to all field units to thwart UNITA infiltration. The army's diverse combat capabilities were indicated by its many regular and motorised infantry brigades with organic or attached armor, artillery, and air defense units; two militia infantry brigades; four antiaircraft artillery brigades; ten tank battalions; and six artillery battalions. These forces were concentrated most heavily in places of strategic importance and recurring conflict: the oil-producing [[Cabinda Province]], the area around the capital, and the southern provinces where UNITA and South African forces operated.'\n\nIt was reported in 2011 that the army was by far the largest of the services with about 120,000 men and women.<ref>[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html Global Defence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909095916/http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html |date=September 9, 2011 }} retrieved August 21, 2011 (de)</ref> The Angolan Army has around 29,000 \"ghost workers\" who remain enrolled in the ranks of the FAA and therefore receive a salary.<ref>[http://www.radioecclesia.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1686:18-anos-das-for-armadas-angolanas&catid=130:sociedade&Itemid=483, R\u00e1dio Ecclesia: 18 anos das For\u00e7as Armadas Angolanas] retrieved August 22, 2011 (pt)</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] reported that the FAA had six divisions, the 1st, 5th, and 6th with two or three infantry brigades, and the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th with five to six infantry brigades.

It is organized in six aviation regiments, each including several squadrons. To each of the regiments correspond an air base. Besides the aviation regiments, there is also a Pilot Training School.\n\nThe Air Force's personnel total about 8,000; its equipment includes transport aircraft and six [[Russia]]n-manufactured [[Sukhoi Su-27]] [[fighter aircraft]].<ref>IISS Military Balance 2013, 494</ref> In 2002 one was lost during the civil war with UNITA forces.<ref>[http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html globaldefence.net: Angolan Armed Forces] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909095916/http://www.globaldefence.net/streitkraefte-der-welt/afrika/346-angola.html |date=September 9, 2011 }} retrieved August 22, 2011 (de)</ref>\n\nIn 1991, the Air Force/Air Defense Forces had 8,000 personnel and 90 combat-capable aircraft, including 22 fighters, 59 fighter ground attack aircraft and 16 attack helicopters.\n\n== Navy ==\n{{main|Angolan Navy}}\nThe Angola Navy (MGA, ''Marinha de Guerra de Angola'') is the naval component of the FAA. It is organized in two naval zones (North and South), with naval bases in Luanda, Lobito and Namibe. It includes a Marines Brigade and a Marines School, based in Ambriz. The Navy numbers about 1,000 personnel and operates only a handful of small patrol craft and barges.\n\nThe Navy has been neglected and ignored as a military arm mainly due to the guerrilla struggle against the Portuguese and the nature of the civil war. From the early 1990s to the present the Angolan Navy has shrunk from around 4,200 personnel to around 1,000, resulting in the loss of skills and expertise needed to maintain equipment. In order to protect Angola\u2019s 1 600&nbsp;km long coastline, the Angolan Navy is undergoing modernisation but is still lacking in many ways.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Portugal has been providing training through its Technical Military Cooperation (CTM) programme. The Navy is requesting procurement of a frigate, three corvettes, three offshore patrol vessel and additional fast patrol boats.\n\nMost of the vessels in the navy's inventory dates back from the 1980s or earlier, and many of its ships are inoperable due to age and lack of maintenance. However the navy acquired new boats from Spain and France in the 1990s. Germany has delivered several [[Fast Attack Craft]] for border protection in 2011.\n\nIn September 2014 it was reported that the Angolan Navy would acquire seven [[Maca\u00e9-class patrol vessel]]s from Brazil as part of a Technical Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) covering the production of the vessels as part of Angola\u2019s Naval Power Development Programme (Pronaval).<ref name=DWMacae>{{cite news|title=Angolan Navy acquiring seven patrol vessels|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=36188:angolan-navy-acquiring-seven-patrol-vessels-from-brazil&catid=51:Sea&Itemid=106|accessdate=14 November 2014|agency=defenceWeb|publisher=defenceWeb|date=9 September 2014}}</ref> The military of Angola aims to modernize its naval capability, presumably due to a rise in maritime piracy within the Gulf of Guinea which may have an adverse effect on the country's economy.\n\nThe navy's current known inventory includes the following:\n\n* [[Fast attack craft]]\n** 4 Mandume class craft (Bazan Cormoran type, refurbished in 2009)\n* [[Patrol boat|Patrol Boats]]\n** 3 18.3m long Patrulheiro patrol boats (refurbished in 2002)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/print-version/sa-boat-builder-refurbishes-vessels-for-angola-2002-11-22|title=Engineering News - SA boat builder refurbishes vessels for Angola|publisher=|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref>\n** 5 ARESA PVC-170\n** 2 [[Namacurra-class harbour patrol boat]]s\n* Fisheries Patrol Boats\n** Ngola Kiluange and Nzinga Mbandi (delivered in September and October 2012 from [[Damen Group|Damen Shipyards]])(Operated by Navy personnel under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries)\n** 28 metre FRV 2810 (Pensador) (Operated by Navy personnel under the Ministry of Agriculture, Rural Development and Fisheries)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defenceweb.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=29331:angola&catid=119:african-militaries&Itemid=255|title=Angola|author=Guy Martin|publisher=|accessdate=December 25, 2014}}</ref>\n* Landing craft\n** [[LDM-400]] - 1 or 3 (reportedly has serviceability issues)\n* Coastal defense equipment (CRTOC)\n** [[SS-C1]] Sepal radar system\n\nThe navy also has several aircraft for maritime patrol:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The Angolan special forces follow the general model of the analogous Portuguese special forces, receiving a similar training.\n\nThe Commandos and the Special forces are part of the Special Forces Brigade (BRIFE, ''Brigada de For\u00e7as Especiais''), based at Cabo Ledo, in the [[Bengo Province]]. The BRIFE includes two battalions of commandos, a battalion of special operations and sub-units of combat support and service support. The BRIFE also included the Special Actions Group (GAE, ''Grupo de A\u00e7\u00f5es Especiais''), which is presently inactive and that was dedicated to long range reconnaissance, covert and sabotage operations. In the Cabo Ledo base is also installed the Special Forces Training School (EFFE, ''Escola de Forma\u00e7\u00e3o de For\u00e7as Especiais''). Both the BRIFE and the EFFE are directly under the Directorate of Special Forces of the General Staff of the Armed Forces.\n\nThe marines (''fuzileiros navais'') constitute the Marines Brigade of the Angolan Navy. The Marines Brigade is not permanently dependent of the Directorate of Special Forces, but can detach their units and elements to be put under the command of that body for the conduction of exercises or real operations.\n\nSince the disbandment of the Angolan Parachute Battalion in 2004, the FAA do not have a specialized paratrooper unit. However, elements of the commandos, special operations and marines are parachute qualified.\n\n== Foreign deployments ==\nThe FAPLA's main counterinsurgency effort was directed against UNITA in the southeast, and its conventional capabilities were demonstrated principally in the undeclared [[South African Border War]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The FAPLA first performed its external assistance mission with the dispatch of 1,000 to 1,500 troops to [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]] in 1977 to bolster the socialist regime of President Manuel Pinto da Costa. During the next several years, Angolan forces conducted joint exercises with their counterparts and exchanged technical operational visits. The Angolan expeditionary force was reduced to about 500 in early 1985.\n\nThe Angolan Armed Forces were controversially involved in training the armed forces of fellow [[Lusophone]] states [[Cape Verde]] and Guinea-Bissau. In the case of the latter, the [[2012 Guinea-Bissau coup d'\u00e9tat]] was cited by the coup leaders as due to Angola's involvement in trying to \"reform\" the military in connivance with the civilian leadership.\n\nA small number of FAA personnel are stationed in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (Kinshasa) and the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville). A presence during the unrest in [[Ivory Coast]], 2010&ndash;2011, were not officially confirmed. However, the ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', citing ''[[Jeune Afrique]]'', said that among President [[Gbagbo]]'s guards were 92 personnel of President Dos Santos's Presidential Guard Unit.<ref>[http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/elfenbeinkueste-gbagbos-letzte-trumpfkarte-als-maertyrer-sterben-1628414.html Gbagbos letzte Trumpfkarte: als M\u00e4rtyrer sterben], 7 April 2011</ref> Angola is basically interested in the participation of the FAA operations of the [[African Union]] and has formed special units for this purpose.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |month= |title=World Defence Almanac  |journal=Military Technology |volume= XXXII |issue= 1 |pages=301\u2013302 |publisher=Monch Publishing Group |location=Bonn, Germany |issn=0722-3226 }}\n*[[Human Rights Watch]], [https://www.hrw.org/reports/1999/angola/ Angola Unravels: The Rise and Fall of the Lusaka Peace Process], October 1999\n*Utz Ebertz and Marie M\u00fcller, Legacy of a resource-fueled war: The role of generals in Angola\u2019s mining sector, BICC Focus, June 2013\n*Area Handbook for Angola, August 1967, Angola, A Country Study (1979 and 1991)\n*Rocky Williams, \"National defence reform and the African Union.\" [[SIPRI]] Yearbook 2004: 231-249.\n*Weigert, Stephen L.

Since then, it has focused on improving relationships with [[Western world|Western countries]], cultivating links with other Portuguese-speaking countries, and asserting its own national interests in [[Central Africa]] through military and diplomatic intervention. In 1993, it established formal diplomatic relations with the [[United States]]. It has entered the [[Southern African Development Community]] as a vehicle for improving ties with its largely Anglophone neighbors to the south. [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]] joined Angola in its military intervention in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], where Angolan troops remain in support of the [[Joseph Kabila]] government. It also has intervened in the [[Republic of the Congo]] (Brazzaville) to support the existing government in that country.\n\nSince 1998, Angola has successfully worked with the [[United Nations Security Council]] to impose and carry out sanctions on [[UNITA]]. More recently, it has extended those efforts to controls on [[conflict diamonds]], the primary source of revenue for UNITA during the Civil War that ended in 2002. At the same time, Angola has promoted the revival of the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries ([[CPLP]]) as a forum for cultural exchange and expanding ties with [[Portugal]] (its former ruler) and [[Brazil]] (which shares many cultural affinities with Angola) in particular.  Angola is a member of the [[Port Management Association of Eastern and Southern Africa]] (PMAESA).\n\n==Sub-Saharan Africa==\n\n===Cape Verde===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013Cape Verde relations}}\n[[Cape Verde]] signed a friendship accord with [[Angola]] in December 1975, shortly after Angola gained its independence. Cape Verde and [[Guinea-Bissau]] served as stop-over points for [[Cuban troops]] on their way to Angola to fight [[UNITA]] rebels and [[South Africa]]n troops. [[Prime Minister of Cape Verde|Prime Minister]] [[Pedro Pires]] sent [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of the People|FARP]] soldiers to Angola where they served as the personal bodyguards of [[Angolan President]] [[Jos\u00e9 Eduardo dos Santos]].<ref name=b>{{cite book|last=Lobban|first=Richard|year=1995|title=Cape Verde:Crioulo Colony to Independent Nation|pages=111\u2013112}}</ref>\n\n===Democratic Republic of the Congo===\nMany thousands of Angolans fled the country after the civil war. More than 20,000 people were forced to leave the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] in 2009, an action the DR Congo said was in retaliation for regular expulsion of Congolese diamond miners who were in Angola illegally. Angola sent a delegation to DR Congo's capital [[Kinshasa]] and succeeded in stopping government-forced expulsions which had become a \"tit-for-tat\"<ref name=Bearak /> immigration dispute. \"Congo and Angola have agreed to suspend expulsions from both sides of the border,\" said Lambert Mende, DR Congo information minister, in October 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Congo and Angola 'end expulsions' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8304282.stm|date=13 October 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-10-13 | location=London}}</ref> \"We never challenged the expulsions themselves; we challenged the way they were being conducted \u2014 all the beating of people and looting their goods, even sometimes their clothes,\" Mende said.<ref name=Bearak>{{cite news|author=Bearak, Barry|title=Congo and Angola Agree to End Expulsions |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/14/world/africa/14angola.html|date=13 October 2009|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-10-13}}</ref>\n\n===Guinea-Bissau===\nFollowing a request by the government of [[Guinea-Bissau]], Angola sent there a contingent of about 300 troops meant to help putting an end to the political-military unrest in that country, and to reorganize the local military forces. In fact, these troops were perceived as a kind of [[Pretorian Guard]] for the ruling party, [[PAIGC]]. In the beginning of April 2012, when a new military [[Coup d'\u00e9tat]] was under preparation, the Angolan regime decided to withdraw its military mission from Guinea-Bissau.\n\n===Namibia===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013Namibia relations}}\nNamibia borders Angola to the south. In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defense pact with its northern neighbor [[Angola]].<ref name=\"Situation Report\">{{cite web\n|first=Vincent\n|last=William\n|url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/publ/opendoc.pdf?tbl=RSDCOI&id=3ae6a6cb8&page=publ\n|title=Namibia: Situation Report\n|publisher=United Nations High Commission on Refugees\n|accessdate=2006-08-26\n}}</ref>\nThis affected the [[Angolan Civil War]] that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party [[SWAPO]] sought to support the ruling party [[MPLA]] in Angola against the rebel movement [[UNITA]], whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s UNITA.\n\n===Nigeria===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013Nigeria relations}}\nAngolan-Nigerian relations are primarily based on their roles as oil exporting nations. Both are members of the [[Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries]], the [[African Union]] and other multilateral organizations.\n\n===South Africa===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013South Africa relations}}\nAngola-South Africa relations are quite strong as the ruling parties in both nations, the African National Congress in South Africa and the MPLA in Angola, fought together during the Angolan Civil War and South African Border War. They fought against UNITA rebels, based in Angola, and the apartheid-era government in South Africa who supported them. Nelson Mandela mediated between the MPLA and UNITA factions during the last years of Angola's civil war.\n\n===Zimbabwe===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013Zimbabwe relations}}\nAngola-Zimbabwe relations have remained cordial since the birth of both states, Angola in 1975 and Zimbabwe in 1979, during the [[Cold War]].  While Angola's foreign policy shifted to a pro-U.S. stance based on [[Economy of Angola|substantial economic ties]], under the rule of [[President of Zimbabwe|President]] [[Robert Mugabe]] Zimbabwe's ties with the [[Western world|West]] soured in the late 1990s.\n\n==Europe==\n\n===Armenia===\n* Both countries established diplomatic relations on 3 October 1994.\n\n===Bulgaria===\n* Date started: 1975-11-20\n* Since 1976, Bulgaria has an embassy in [[Luanda]].<ref>[http://www.mfa.bg/luanda/index.php?lang=en   Bulgarian embassy in Luanda]</ref>\n* Angola is represented in Bulgaria through its embassy in [[Athens]] ([[Greece]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angolanembassy.gr/|title=Untitled Page|website=www.angolanembassy.gr|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===Denmark===\n\n* Denmark is represented in Angola through its embassy in [[Lusaka]] ([[Zambia]]).\n* Angola is represented in Denmark, through its embassy in [[Stockholm]], ([[Sweden]]).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.angolaemb.se/|title=Angola EMB|website=www.angolaemb.se|language=en|access-date=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n\n===France===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013France relations}}\nRelations between the two countries have not always been cordial due to the former [[French government]]'s policy of supporting militant separatists in Angola's [[Cabinda province]] and the international [[Angolagate]] scandal embarrassed both governments by exposing corruption and illicit arms deals. Following French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]]'s visit in 2008, relations have improved.\n\n===Portugal===\n{{main article|Angola\u2013Portugal relations}}\nAngola-Portugal relations have significantly improved since the [[Angola]]n government abandoned [[communism]] and nominally embraced [[democracy]] in 1991, embracing a pro-[[Angola-United States relations|U.S.]] and to a lesser degree pro-[[Europe]] foreign policy.

He saw extensive combat during his military career, fighting actions in the [[Black Hawk War]], [[Texas War of Independence]], the [[Mexican\u2013American War]], the [[Utah War]], and the [[American Civil War]].\n\nConsidered by Confederate States President [[Jefferson Davis]] to be the finest general officer in the Confederacy before the later emergence of [[Robert E. Lee]], he was killed early in the Civil War at the [[Battle of Shiloh]] on April 6, 1862. Johnston was the highest-ranking officer, Union or Confederate, killed during the entire war. Davis believed the loss of Gen. Johnston \"was the turning point of our fate.\"\n\nJohnston was unrelated to Confederate general [[Joseph E. Johnston]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nJohnston was born in [[Washington, Kentucky]], the youngest son of Dr. John and Abigail (Harris) Johnston. His father was a native of [[Salisbury, Connecticut]]. Although Albert Johnston was born in Kentucky, he lived much of his life in [[Texas]], which he considered his home. He was first educated at [[Transylvania University]] in [[Lexington, Kentucky]], where he met fellow student [[Jefferson Davis]]. Both were appointed to the [[United States Military Academy]] at [[West Point, New York]], Davis two years behind Johnston.<ref name=\"Woodworth46\">Woodworth, p. 46.</ref> In 1826, Johnston graduated eighth of 41 cadets in his class from West Point with a commission as a [[brevet (military)|brevet]] [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] in the [[2nd Infantry Regiment (United States)|2nd U.S. Infantry]].<ref name=\"Eicher322\">Eicher, p. 322.</ref>\n\nJohnston was assigned to posts in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Missouri]] and served in the brief [[Black Hawk War]] in 1832 as chief of staff to Bvt. Brig. Gen. [[Henry Atkinson (soldier)|Henry Atkinson]].\n\n==Marriage and family==\nIn 1829 he married Henrietta Preston, sister of Kentucky politician and future Civil War general [[William Preston (Kentucky)|William Preston]]. They had one son, [[William Preston Johnston]], who became a colonel in the Confederate States Army.<ref>[http://www.csawardept.com/history/Cabinet/WPJohnston/index.html W.P. Johnston biography.]</ref> The senior Johnston resigned his commission in 1834 in order to care for his dying wife in Kentucky, who succumbed two years later to [[tuberculosis]].<ref name=Woodworth46/>\n\nAfter serving as Secretary of War for the Republic of Texas from 1838 to 1840, Johnston resigned and returned to Kentucky. In 1843, he married Eliza Griffin, his late wife's first cousin. The couple moved to Texas, where they settled on a large [[Plantations in the American South|plantation]] in [[Brazoria County, Texas|Brazoria County]]. Johnston named the property \"China Grove\". Here they raised Johnston's two children from his first marriage and the first three children born to Eliza and him. (A sixth child was born later when they lived in [[Los Angeles]]).\n\n==Texas Army==\nIn 1836 Johnston moved to Texas.  He enlisted as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in the Texas Army during the [[Texas War of Independence]] against the Republic of Mexico.  He was named [[Adjutant General]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] in the Republic of Texas Army on August 5, 1836. On January 31, 1837, he became senior [[brigadier general]] in command of the Texas Army.\n\nOn February 5, 1837, he fought in a duel with Texas Brig. Gen. [[Felix Huston]], as they challenged each other for the command of the Texas Army; Johnston refused to fire on Huston and lost the position after he was wounded in the pelvis.\n\nOn December 22, 1838, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]], the second president of the [[Republic of Texas]], appointed Johnston as Secretary of War. He provided for the defense of the Texas border against Mexican invasion, and in 1839 conducted a campaign against [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in northern Texas. In February 1840, he resigned and returned to Kentucky.\n\n==United States Army==\n[[File:AlbertSJohnston.jpg|thumb|Johnston as commander of the Department of Utah. Portrait taken by [[Samuel C. Mills]] at [[Camp Floyd]], Utah Territory, winter of 1858\u201359.]]\nJohnston returned to Texas during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846-1848), under General [[Zachary Taylor]] as a [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] of the 1st Texas Rifle Volunteers. The enlistments of his volunteers ran out just before the [[Battle of Monterrey]]. Johnston convinced a few volunteers to stay and fight as he served as the inspector general of volunteers and fought at the battles of Monterrey and [[Battle of Buena Vista|Buena Vista]].\n\nHe remained on his plantation after the war until he was appointed by later 12th President [[Zachary Taylor]] to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] as a [[Major (United States)|major]] and was made a paymaster in December 1849. He served in that role for more than five years, making six tours, and traveling more than {{convert|4000|mi|km}} annually on the Indian frontier of Texas. He served on the Texas frontier at [[Fort Mason (Texas)|Fort Mason]] and elsewhere in the West.\n\nIn 1855, 14th President [[Franklin Pierce]] appointed him colonel of the new 2nd U.S. Cavalry (the unit that preceded the modern [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th U.S.]]), a new regiment, which he organized. On August 19, 1856, Gen. [[Persifor Smith]], at the request of Kansas Territorial Governor Wilson Shannon, sent Col. Johnston with 1300 men composed of the 2d Cavalry Dragoons from [[Fort Riley]], a battalion of the 6th Infantry and [[Albion P. Howe|Capt. Howe's]] artillery company from [[Jefferson Barracks Military Post|Jefferson Barracks]], near [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to protect the [[Kansas Territory| territorial]] capital at [[Lecompton, Kansas|Lecompton]] from an imminent attack by [[James Henry Lane (Union general)|James Henry Lane]] and his abolitionist \"Army of the North.\"\n\n==Utah War==\nAs a key figure in the [[Utah War]], Johnston led U.S. troops who established a non-[[Mormons|Mormon]] government in the formerly [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormon]] territory. He received a [[Brevet (military)|brevet]] promotion to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]] in 1857 for his service in Utah. He spent 1860 in Kentucky until December 21, when he sailed for California to take command of the Department of the Pacific.\n\n==Civil War==\n[[File:Albert S. Johnston, head and shoulders portrait (cropped).jpg|thumb|Albert S. Johnston in Confederate Army uniform wearing Three Gold Stars and Wreath on a General's Collar]]\nAt the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Johnston was the commander of the U.S. Army [[Department of the Pacific]] in [[California and the Civil War|California]]. Like many regular army officers from the South, he was opposed to secession. But he resigned his commission soon after he heard of the secession of his adopted state of Texas. It was accepted by the War Department on May 6, 1861, effective May 3.<ref>Johnston, p. 273.</ref> On April 28 he moved to Los Angeles, the home of his wife's brother John Griffin. Considering staying in California with his wife and five children, Johnston remained there until May.\n\nSoon, under suspicion by local Union officials, he evaded arrest and joined the [[Los Angeles Mounted Rifles]] as a private, leaving [[Warner's Ranch]] May 27.<ref>Johnston, pp. 268, 275\u201391.</ref> He participated in their trek across the southwestern deserts to Texas, crossing the [[Colorado River]] into the [[Confederate Territory of Arizona]] on July 4, 1861.\n\nEarly in the Civil War, Confederate President [[Jefferson Davis]] decided that the Confederacy would attempt to hold as much of its territory as possible, and therefore distributed military forces around its borders and coasts.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 18\u201319.</ref> In the summer of 1861, Davis appointed several generals to defend Confederate lines from the Mississippi River east to the Allegheny Mountains.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 17\u201333.</ref>\n\nThe most sensitive, and in many ways the most crucial areas, along the Mississippi River and in western Tennessee along the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] rivers<ref>Woodworth, pp. 20\u201322</ref> were placed under the command of [[Major General (CSA)|Maj. Gen.]] [[Leonidas Polk]] and [[Brigadier General (CSA)|Brig. Gen.]] [[Gideon J. Pillow]]. The latter had initially been in command in Tennessee as that State's top general.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 30\u201332.</ref> Their impolitic occupation of [[Columbus, Kentucky]], on September 3, 1861, two days before Johnston arrived in the Confederacy's capital of [[Richmond in the American Civil War|Richmond, Virginia]], after his cross-country journey, drove Kentucky from its stated neutrality.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 35, 45.</ref><ref>Long, p. 114.</ref> The majority of Kentuckians allied with the Union camp.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 39, 50.</ref> Polk and Pillow's action gave Union [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brig.

Grant]] an excuse to take control of the strategically located town of [[Paducah, Kentucky]], without raising the ire of most Kentuckians and the pro-Union majority in the State legislature.<ref>Woodworth, p. 39.</ref><ref>Long, p. 115.</ref>\n\n===Confederate command in Western Theater===\nOn September 10, 1861, Johnston was assigned to command the huge area of the Confederacy west of the Allegheny Mountains, except for coastal areas. He became commander of the Confederacy's western armies in the area often called the [[Western Theater of the American Civil War|Western Department]] or Western Military Department.<ref name=\"Woodworth51\">Woodworth, p. 51.</ref><ref name=\"Long, p. 116\">Long, p. 116.</ref> Johnston's appointment as a [[General (CSA)|full general]] by his friend and admirer Jefferson Davis already had been confirmed by the Confederate Senate on August 31, 1861. The appointment had been backdated to rank from May 30, 1861, making him the second highest ranking general in the Confederate States Army. Only Adjutant General and Inspector General [[Samuel Cooper (general)|Samuel Cooper]] ranked ahead of him.<ref>Eicher, ''Civil War High Commands.'' p.&nbsp;807. From General Command Line List. Weigley, p.&nbsp;110. McPherson, p.&nbsp;394.</ref> After his appointment, Johnston immediately headed for his new territory.<ref name=\"Woodworth52\">Woodworth, p. 52.</ref> He was permitted to call on governors of Arkansas, Tennessee and Mississippi for new troops, although this authority was largely stifled by politics, especially with respect to Mississippi.<ref name=\"Woodworth51\"/> On September 13, 1861, Johnston ordered Brig. Gen. [[Felix Zollicoffer]] with 4,000 men to occupy [[Cumberland Gap]] in Kentucky in order to block Union troops from coming into eastern Tennessee. The Kentucky legislature had voted to side with the Union after the occupation of Columbus by Polk.<ref name=\"Woodworth52\"/> By September 18, Johnston had Brig. Gen. [[Simon Bolivar Buckner]] with another 4,000 men blocking the railroad route to Tennessee at [[Bowling Green, Kentucky]].<ref name=\"Woodworth52\"/><ref>Long, p. 119.</ref>\n\nJohnston had fewer than 40,000 men spread throughout Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas and Missouri.<ref name=\"Woodworth53\">Woodworth, p. 53.</ref> Of these, 10,000 were in Missouri under [[Missouri State Guard]] Maj. Gen. [[Sterling Price]].<ref name=\"Woodworth53\"/> Johnston did not quickly gain many recruits when he first requested them from the governors, but his more serious problem was lacking sufficient arms and ammunition for the troops he already had.<ref name=\"Woodworth53\"/> As the Confederate government concentrated efforts on the units in the East, they gave Johnston small numbers of reinforcements and minimal amounts of arms and material.<ref name=\"Woodworth55\">Woodworth, p. 55.</ref> Johnston maintained his defense by conducting raids and other measures to make it appear he had larger forces than he did, a strategy that worked for several months.<ref name=\"Woodworth55\"/> Johnston's tactics had so annoyed and confused Union Brig. Gen. [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] in Kentucky that he became paranoid and mentally unstable. Sherman overestimated Johnston's forces, and had to be relieved by Brig. Gen. [[Don Carlos Buell]] on November 9, 1861.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 55\u201356</ref><ref>Long, p. 138.</ref><ref>McPherson, p. 394 says Johnston had 70,000 troops to defend his territory between the Appalachians and the Ozarks by the end of 1861.</ref>\n\n===Battle of Mill Springs===\nEastern Tennessee was held for the Confederacy by two unimpressive brigadier generals appointed by Jefferson Davis: Felix Zollicoffer, a brave but untrained and inexperienced officer, and soon-to-be Maj. Gen. [[George B. Crittenden]], a former U.S. Army officer with apparent alcohol problems.<ref>Woodworth, p. 61</ref> While Crittenden was away in Richmond, Zollicoffer moved his forces to the north bank of the upper Cumberland River near Mill Springs (now [[Nancy, Kentucky]]), putting the river to his back and his forces into a trap.<ref>Woodworth, p. 65.</ref><ref>Long, pp. 161\u2013162.</ref> Zollicoffer decided it was impossible to obey orders to return to the other side of the river because of scarcity of transport and proximity of Union troops.<ref name=\"Woodworth, p. 66\">Woodworth, p. 66.</ref> When Union Brig. Gen. [[George H. Thomas]] moved against the Confederates, Crittenden decided to attack one of the two parts of Thomas's command at Logan's Cross Roads near Mill Springs before the Union forces could unite.<ref name=\"Woodworth, p. 66\"/> At the [[Battle of Mill Springs]] on January 19, 1862, the ill-prepared Confederates, after a night march in the rain, attacked the Union force with some initial success.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 66\u201367.</ref> As the battle progressed, Zollicoffer was killed, Crittenden was unable to lead the Confederate force (he may have been intoxicated), and the Confederates were turned back and routed by a Union bayonet charge, suffering 533 casualties from their force of 4,000.<ref>Woodworth, p. 67.</ref><ref>Long, p. 162.</ref> The Confederate troops who escaped were assigned to other units as General Crittenden faced an investigation of his conduct.<ref>Woodworth, p. 69.</ref>\n\nAfter the Confederate defeat at the Mill Springs, Davis sent Johnston a brigade and a few other scattered reinforcements. He also assigned him Gen. [[P. G. T. Beauregard]], who was supposed to attract recruits because of his victories early in the war, and act as a competent subordinate for Johnston.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 71\u201372.</ref> The brigade was led by Brig. Gen. [[John B. Floyd]], considered incompetent. He took command at [[Fort Donelson]] as the senior general present just before Union Brig. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] attacked the fort.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 80, 84.</ref> Historians believe the assignment of Beauregard to the west stimulated Union commanders to attack the forts before Beauregard could make a difference in the theater. Union officers heard that he was bringing 15 regiments with him, but this was an exaggeration of his forces.<ref name=\"Woodworth7278\">Woodworth, pp. 72, 78.</ref>\n\n===Fort Henry, Fort Donelson, Nashville===\nBased on the assumption that Kentucky neutrality would act as a shield against a direct invasion from the north, Tennessee initially had sent men to Virginia and concentrated defenses in the Mississippi Valley, circumstances that no longer applied in September 1861.<ref>Woodworth, p. 54.</ref><ref>Eicher, ''The Longest Night''. pp. 111\u2013113.</ref> Even before Johnston arrived in Tennessee, construction of two forts had been started to defend the [[Tennessee River|Tennessee]] and the [[Cumberland River|Cumberland]] rivers, which provided avenues into the State from the north.<ref name=\"Woodworth56\">Woodworth, p. 56.</ref> Both forts were located in Tennessee in order to respect Kentucky neutrality, but these were not in ideal locations.<ref name=\"Woodworth56\"/><ref name=\"Long142\">Long, p. 142</ref><ref>Weigley, p. 108</ref><ref>McPherson, p. 393.</ref> [[Battle of Fort Henry|Fort Henry]] on the Tennessee River was in an unfavorable low-lying location, commanded by hills on the Kentucky side of the river.<ref name=\"Woodworth56\"/> [[Fort Donelson]] on the Cumberland River, although in a better location, had a vulnerable land side and did not have enough heavy artillery to defend against gunboats.<ref name=\"Woodworth56\"/>\n\nMaj. Gen. Polk ignored the problems of the forts when he took command. After Johnston took command, Polk at first refused to comply with Johnston's order to send an engineer, Lt. Joseph K. Dixon, to inspect the forts.<ref name=\"Woodworth57\">Woodworth, p. 57.</ref> After Johnston asserted his authority, Polk had to allow Dixon to proceed. Dixon recommended that the forts be maintained and strengthened, although they were not in ideal locations, because much work had been done on them and the Confederates might not have time to build new ones. Johnston accepted his recommendations.<ref name=\"Woodworth57\"/> Johnston wanted Major [[Alexander P. Stewart]] to command the forts but President Davis appointed Brig. Gen.

As the Confederate forces overran the Union camps, Johnston seemed to be everywhere, personally leading and rallying troops up and down the line on his horse. At about 2:30&nbsp;pm, while leading one of those charges against a Union camp near the \"Peach Orchard,\" he was wounded, taking a bullet behind his right knee. He apparently did not think the wound was serious at the time, or even possibly did not feel it. It is possible that Johnston's duel in 1837 had caused nerve damage or numbness to his right leg and that he did not feel the wound to his leg as a result. The bullet had in fact clipped a part of his [[popliteal artery]] and his boot was filling up with blood.  There were no medical personnel on scene at the time, since Johnston had sent his personal surgeon to care for the wounded Confederate troops and Yankee prisoners earlier in the battle.<ref>http://civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jdf.htm</ref>\n\nWithin a few minutes, Johnston was observed by his staff to be nearly fainting. Among his staff was [[Isham G. Harris]], the [[Governor of Tennessee]], who had ceased to make any real effort to function as governor after learning that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had appointed [[Andrew Johnson]] as military governor of Tennessee. Seeing Johnston slumping in his saddle and his face turning deathly pale, Harris asked: \"General, are you wounded?\" Johnston glanced down at his leg wound, then faced Harris and replied in a weak voice his last words: \"Yes... and I fear seriously.\" Harris and other staff officers removed Johnston from his horse and carried him to a small ravine near the \"Hornets Nest\" and desperately tried to aid the general who had lost consciousness by this point. Harris then sent an aide to fetch Johnston's surgeon, but did not apply a tourniquet to Johnson's wounded leg. Before a doctor could be found, Johnston died from blood loss a few minutes later. It is believed that Johnston may have lived for as long as one hour after receiving his fatal wound.  Ironically, it was later discovered that Johnston had a tourniquet in his pocket when he died.<ref>http://civilwarlandscapes.org/cwla/states/tn/sh/ftour/1jdf.htm</ref>\n\nHarris and the other officers wrapped General Johnston's body in a blanket so as not to damage the troops' morale with the sight of the dead general. Johnston and his wounded horse, named Fire Eater, were taken to his field headquarters on the Corinth road, where his body remained in his tent until the Confederate Army withdrew to Corinth the next day, April 7, 1862, after failing to gain a decisive victory over the Union armies. From there, his body was taken to the home of Colonel William Inge, which had been his headquarters in Corinth. It was covered in the Confederate flag and lay in state for several hours.<ref>Sword, pp. 270\u201373, 443\u201346; Cunningham, pp. 273\u201376; Smith, pp. 26\u201334. Sword offers evidence that Johnston lived as long as an hour after receiving his fatal wound.</ref>\n\nIt is probable that a Confederate soldier fired the fatal round. No Union soldiers were observed to have ever gotten behind Johnston during the fatal charge, while it is known that many Confederates were firing at the Union lines while Johnston charged well in advance of his soldiers.<ref>Sword, p. 444.</ref>  Furthermore, the surgeon who later dug the bullet out of Johnston's leg identified the round as one fired from a [[Pattern 1853 Enfield]].  No Union troops in the area where Johnston was hit had been issued Enfield rifles, whereas the Enfield rifle was standard issue for the Confederate forces Johnston was leading.<ref>http://trrcobb.blogspot.com/2011/05/who-killed-albert-sidney-johnston.html</ref>\n\nJohnston was the highest-ranking fatality of the war on either side,<ref name=\"Eicher322\">Eicher, p. 322.</ref><ref>Johnston is the only four-star (full) American general ever killed in battle.

The re-interment occurred in 1867. Forty years later, the state appointed [[Elisabet Ney]] to design a monument and sculpture of him to be erected at the grave site.\n\nThe [[Texas Historical Commission]] has erected a historical marker near the entrance of what was once Johnston's [[plantations in the American South|plantation]].

As said by the officer in the story, \"In this age of Realien advancement, who knows what goes on in the mind of those responsible for these mechanical dolls.\" The term made an impact into English [[pulp science fiction]] starting from [[Jack Williamson]]'s ''[[The Cometeers]]'' (1936) and the distinction between mechanical robots and fleshy androids was popularized by [[Edmond Hamilton]]'s [[Captain Future]] (1940\u20131944).<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nAlthough [[Karel Capek|Karel \u010capek's]] robots in ''[[R.U.R.|R.U.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)]]'' (1921)\u2014the play that introduced the word ''[[robot]]'' to the world\u2014were organic artificial humans, the word \"robot\" has come to primarily refer to mechanical humans, animals, and other beings.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> The term \"android\" can mean either one of these,<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> while a cyborg (\"cybernetic organism\" or \"bionic man\") would be a creature that is a combination of organic and mechanical parts.\n\nThe term \"[[Droid (robot)|droid]]\", popularized by [[George Lucas]] in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' film and now used widely within science fiction, originated as an abridgment of \"android\", but has been used by Lucas and others to mean any robot, including distinctly non-human form machines like [[R2-D2]]. The word \"android\" was used in ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]'' episode \"[[What Are Little Girls Made Of?]]\" The abbreviation \"andy\", coined as a [[pejorative]] by writer [[Philip K.

In some fictional works, the difference between a robot and android is only their appearance, with androids being made to look like humans on the outside but with robot-like internal mechanics.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> In other stories, authors have used the word \"android\" to mean a wholly organic, yet artificial, creation.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/> Other fictional depictions of androids fall somewhere in between.<ref name=\"Stableford2006\"/>\n\nEric G. Wilson, who defines androids as a \"synthetic human being\", distinguishes between three types of androids, based on their body's composition:\n* the mummy type - where androids are made of \"dead things\" or \"stiff, inanimate, natural material\", such as mummies, puppets, dolls and statues\n* the golem type - androids made from flexible, possibly organic material, including golems and homunculi\n* the automaton type - androids which are a mix of dead and living parts, including automatons and robots<ref name=\"Wilson2006\"/>\n\nAlthough human morphology is not necessarily the ideal form for working robots, the fascination in developing robots that can mimic it can be found historically in the assimilation of two concepts: ''[[Simulacrum|simulacra]]'' (devices that exhibit likeness) and ''[[Automata theory|automata]]'' (devices that have independence).\n\n==Projects==\nSeveral projects aiming to create androids that look, and, to a certain degree, speak or act like a human being have been launched or are underway.\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Actroid-DER 01.jpg|thumb|DER 01, a Japanese [[actroid]]]]\n\n[[Japanese robotics]] have been leading the field since the 1970s.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tQqVCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA66 ''Robotics and Mechatronics: Proceedings of the 4th IFToMM International Symposium on Robotics and Mechatronics'', page 66]</ref> [[Waseda University]] initiated the WABOT project in 1967, and in 1972 completed the WABOT-1, the first android, a full-scale humanoid intelligent robot.<ref>http://www.humanoid.waseda.ac.jp/booklet/kato_2-j.html</ref><ref name=\"androidworld.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.androidworld.com/prod06.htm|title=Historical Android Projects|work=androidworld.com}}</ref> Its limb control system allowed it to walk with the lower limbs, and to grip and transport objects with hands, using tactile sensors.

It was capable of playing the organ. Wabot-2 had 10 fingers and two feet, and was able to read a score of music. It was also able to accompany a person.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uc3m.es/uc3m/dpto/IN/dpin04/2historygroupwabo2.html |title=2history |accessdate=31 August 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071012203052/http://uc3m.es/uc3m/dpto/IN/dpin04/2historygroupwabo2.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 12 October 2007}}</ref> In 1986, [[Honda]] began its humanoid research and development program, to create humanoid robots capable of interacting successfully with humans.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://world.honda.com/ASIMO/P3/ |title=P3|publisher=Honda Worldwide |accessdate=1 September 2007 }}</ref>\n\nThe Intelligent Robotics Lab, directed by [[Hiroshi Ishiguro]] at [[Osaka University]], and Kokoro Co., Ltd. have demonstrated the [[Actroid]] at [[Expo 2005]] in [[Aichi Prefecture]], Japan and released the [[Telenoid R1]] in 2010. In 2006, Kokoro Co. developed a new ''DER 2'' android. The height of the human body part of DER2 is 165&nbsp;cm. There are 47 mobile points. DER2 can not only change its expression but also move its hands and feet and twist its body. The \"air servosystem\" which Kokoro Co. developed originally is used for the actuator. As a result of having an actuator controlled precisely with air pressure via a servosystem, the movement is very fluid and there is very little noise. DER2 realized a slimmer body than that of the former version by using a smaller cylinder. Outwardly DER2 has a more beautiful proportion. Compared to the previous model, DER2 has thinner arms and a wider repertoire of expressions. Once programmed, it is able to choreograph its motions and gestures with its voice.\n\nThe Intelligent Mechatronics Lab, directed by Hiroshi Kobayashi at the [[Tokyo University of Science]], has developed an android head called ''Saya'', which was exhibited at Robodex 2002 in [[Yokohama]], Japan. There are several other initiatives around the world involving humanoid research and development at this time, which will hopefully introduce a broader spectrum of realized technology in the near future. Now Saya is ''working'' at the Science University of Tokyo as a guide.\n\nThe [[Waseda University]] (Japan) and [[NTT docomo|NTT Docomo's]] manufacturers have succeeded in creating a shape-shifting robot ''WD-2''. It is capable of changing its face. At first, the creators decided the positions of the necessary points to express the outline, eyes, nose, and so on of a certain person. The robot expresses its face by moving all points to the decided positions, they say. The first version of the robot was first developed back in 2003. After that, a year later, they made a couple of major improvements to the design. The robot features an elastic mask made from the average head dummy. It uses a driving system with a 3DOF unit. The WD-2 robot can change its facial features by activating specific facial points on a mask, with each point possessing three [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]]. This one has 17 facial points, for a total of 56 degrees of freedom. As for the materials they used, the WD-2's mask is fabricated with a highly elastic material called Septom, with bits of steel wool mixed in for added strength. Other technical features reveal a shaft driven behind the mask at the desired facial point, driven by a DC motor with a simple pulley and a slide screw. Apparently, the researchers can also modify the shape of the mask based on actual human faces. To \"copy\" a face, they need only a 3D scanner to determine the locations of an individual's 17 facial points. After that, they are then driven into position using a laptop and 56 motor control boards. In addition, the researchers also mention that the shifting robot can even display an individual's hair style and skin color if a photo of their face is projected onto the 3D Mask.\n\n===Singapore===\nProf Nadia Thalmann, a Nanyang Technological University scientist, directed efforts of the Institute for Media Innovation along with the School of Computer Engineering in the development of a social robot, Nadine.  Nadine is powered by software similar to Apple\u2019s [[Siri]] or Microsoft\u2019s [[Cortana (software)|Cortana]]. Nadine may become a personal assistant in offices and homes in future, or she may become a companion for the young and the elderly.\n\nAssoc Prof Gerald Seet from the School of Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering and the BeingThere Centre led a three-year R&D development in tele-presence robotics, creating EDGAR. A remote user can control EDGAR with the user\u2019s face and expressions displayed on the robot\u2019s face in real time. The robot also mimics their upper body movements.\n<ref name=\"singapore_NTU\">{{cite web|url=http://media.ntu.edu.sg/NewsReleases/Pages/newsdetail.aspx?news=fde9bfb6-ee3f-45f0-8c7b-f08bc1a9a179|title=NTU scientists unveil social and telepresence robots|accessdate=31 December 2015}}</ref>\n\n===South Korea===\n[[File:Ever-2.jpg|thumb|200px|[[EveR-2]], the first android that has the ability to [[singing|sing]]]]\n\n[[KITECH]] researched and developed [[EveR-1]], an android interpersonal communications model capable of emulating human emotional expression via facial \"musculature\" and capable of rudimentary conversation, having a vocabulary of around 400 words.

The climate is also influenced by the presence of the Rocky Mountains to the southwest, which disrupt the flow of the [[prevailing westerlies|prevailing westerly winds]] and cause them to drop most of their moisture on the western slopes of the mountain ranges before reaching the province, casting a [[rain shadow]] over much of Alberta. The northerly location and isolation from the weather systems of the Pacific Ocean cause Alberta to have a dry climate with little moderation from the ocean.

Both yellow and white [[sweet clover]] can be found throughout the southern and central areas of the province.\n\nThe trees in the parkland region of the province grow in clumps and belts on the hillsides. These are largely [[deciduous]], typically [[aspen]], [[Populus|poplar]], and [[willow]]. Many species of willow and other shrubs grow in virtually any terrain. On the north side of the North Saskatchewan River evergreen forests prevail for thousands of square kilometres. [[aspen|Aspen poplar]], [[balsam poplar]] (or in some parts [[Populus deltoides|cottonwood]]), and [[paper birch]] are the primary large deciduous species. [[Conifer]]s include [[jack pine]], Rocky Mountain pine, [[lodgepole pine]], both white and black [[spruce]], and the deciduous conifer [[tamarack]].\n\n==== Fauna ====\n[[File:Ovis canadensis 2.jpg|thumb|The [[bighorn sheep]] is Alberta's provincial animal]]\nThe four climatic regions ([[alpine climate|alpine]], [[boreal forest]], [[Aspen parkland|parkland]], and [[prairie]]) of Alberta are home to many different species of animals. The south and central prairie was the land of the [[American bison|bison]], commonly known as buffalo, its grasses providing pasture and breeding ground for millions of buffalo. The buffalo population was decimated during early settlement, but since then buffalo have made a comeback, living on farms and in parks all over Alberta.\n\nAlberta is home to many large [[carnivore]]s. Among them are the [[grizzly bear|grizzly]] and [[American black bear|black bears]], which are found in the mountains and wooded regions. Smaller carnivores of the [[canidae|canine]] and [[Felidae|feline]] families include [[coyote]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], fox, [[lynx]], [[bobcat]] and [[mountain lion]] (cougar).\n\n[[Herbivore|Herbivorous]] animals are found throughout the province. [[Moose]], [[mule deer]], [[elk]], and [[white-tail deer]] are found in the wooded regions, and [[pronghorn]] can be found in the prairies of southern Alberta. [[Bighorn sheep]] and [[mountain goat]]s live in the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Rabbits, [[porcupine]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[squirrel]]s and many species of rodents and reptiles live in every corner of the province. Alberta is home to only one variety of venomous snake, the prairie [[rattlesnake]].\n\n[[File:Mill woods edmonton waterfowl.JPG|thumb|left|Water birds in Edmonton]]Central and northern Alberta and the region farther north is the nesting ground of many migratory birds. Vast numbers of [[duck]]s, [[goose|geese]], [[swan]]s and [[pelican]]s arrive in Alberta every spring and nest on or near one of the hundreds of small lakes that dot northern Alberta. [[Eagle]]s, [[hawk]]s, [[owl]]s and [[crow]]s are plentiful, and a huge variety of smaller seed and insect-eating birds can be found. Alberta, like other [[temperate]] regions, is home to [[mosquito]]es, [[fly|flies]], [[wasp]]s, and bees. Rivers and lakes are populated with [[pike (fish)|pike]], [[walleye]], [[Freshwater whitefish|whitefish]], [[rainbow trout|rainbow]], [[Brook trout|speckled]], [[brown trout]], and [[sturgeon]]. [[Bull trout]], native to the province, is Alberta's provincial fish. Turtles are found in some water bodies in the southern part of the province. Frogs and [[salamander]]s are a few of the [[amphibian]]s that make their homes in Alberta.\n\nAlberta is the only province in Canada\u2014as well as one of the few places in the world\u2014that is free of [[brown rat|Norwegian rat]]s.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www1.agric.gov.ab.ca/$department/deptdocs.nsf/all/agdex3441?opendocument | title=The History of Rat Control in Alberta| publisher=Alberta Department of Agriculture| accessdate=January 11, 2007}}</ref> Since the early 1950s, the [[Government of Alberta]] has operated a rat-control program, which has been so successful that only isolated instances of wild rat sightings are reported, usually of rats arriving in the province aboard trucks or by rail.

This area was granted by [[Charles II of England]] to the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) in 1670, and rival fur trading companies were not allowed to trade in it. After the arrival of [[French Canadian]]s in the west around 1731, they settled near fur trading posts, establishing communities such as [[Lac La Biche, Alberta|Lac La Biche]] and [[Bonnyville, Alberta|Bonnyville]]. Fort La Jonqui\u00e8re was established near what is now Calgary in 1752.\n\nThe Athabasca River and the rivers north of it were not in HBC territory because they drained into the Arctic Ocean instead of Hudson Bay, and they were prime habitat for fur-bearing animals. The first explorer of the Athabasca region was [[Peter Pond]], who learned of the [[Methye Portage]], which allowed travel from southern rivers into the rivers north of Rupert's Land. Fur traders formed the [[North West Company]] (NWC) of [[Montreal]] to compete with the HBC in 1779. The NWC occupied the northern part of Alberta territory. Peter Pond built Fort Athabasca on [[Lac la Biche (Alberta)|Lac la Biche]] in 1778. Roderick Mackenzie built [[Fort Chipewyan]] on Lake Athabasca ten years later in 1788. His cousin, Sir [[Alexander Mackenzie (explorer)|Alexander Mackenzie]], followed the [[North Saskatchewan River]] to its northernmost point near Edmonton, then setting northward on foot, trekked to the Athabasca River, which he followed to Lake Athabasca. It was there he discovered the mighty outflow river which bears his name\u2014the [[Mackenzie River]]\u2014which he followed to its outlet in the Arctic Ocean. Returning to Lake Athabasca, he followed the [[Peace River (Canada)|Peace River]] upstream, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean, and so he became the first European to cross the North American continent north of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&id_nbr=2521 | title=Alexander Mackenzie Biography | publisher=Dictionary of Canadian Biography | accessdate=January 5, 2006}}</ref>\n\nThe extreme southernmost portion of Alberta was part of the French (and Spanish) territory of [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]], [[Louisiana Purchase|sold to the United States]] in 1803; in 1818, the portion of Louisiana north of the [[49th parallel north|Forty-Ninth Parallel]] was ceded to Great Britain.<ref>{{cite book | last1=Kennedy | first1=D. | last2=Cohen | first2=L. | last3=Bailey | first3=T. | title=The American Pageant: Volume I: To 1877 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwP8bQsT908C&pg=PA265&dq=1818,+louisiana,+forty&hl=en&sa=X&ei=4uGtU-7uFpebqAbVxIGwDA&ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q=1818%2C%20louisiana%2C%20forty&f=false | publisher=Cengage Learning | date=2010 | location=Boston, MA | page=265 | isbn=978-0-547-16659-9}}</ref>\n\nFur trade expanded in the north, but bloody battles occurred between the rival HBC and NWC, and in 1821 the British government forced them to merge to stop the hostilities.<ref>{{cite book | last=Easterbrook | first=W.

Across the province, the once common [[grain elevator]] is slowly being lost as rail lines are decreasing; farmers typically truck the grain to central points.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gerson|first1=Jen|title=Preserving prairie cathedrals: Progress is leaving Alberta's historic grain elevators in its wake|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/preserving-prairie-cathedrals-progress-is-leaving-albertas-historic-grain-elevators-in-its-wake|accessdate=18 January 2017|work=National Post|publisher=Postmedia Network Inc.|date=7 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nAlberta is the leading [[beekeeping]] province of Canada, with some beekeepers wintering [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]]s indoors in specially designed barns in southern Alberta, then migrating north during the summer into the [[Peace River (Alberta)|Peace River]] valley where the season is short but the working days are long for [[Western honey bee|honeybee]]s to produce honey from [[clover]] and [[fireweed]].

There are also natural attractions like [[Elk Island National Park]], [[Wood Buffalo National Park]], and the [[Columbia Icefield]].\n\nAccording to Alberta Economic Development, Calgary and Edmonton both host over four million visitors annually. [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Jasper, Alberta|Jasper]] and the [[Canadian Rockies|Rocky Mountains]] are visited by about three million people per year.<ref name=\"Geography & Climate:Encourage Canadian Immigration\">{{cite web | url=http://www.akcanada.com/lic_alberta.cfm | title=Living in Canada : Alberta | publisher=AKCanada | accessdate=November 8, 2009}}</ref> Alberta tourism relies heavily on [[Southern Ontario]] tourists, as well as tourists from other parts of Canada, the United States, and many other countries.\n\n[[Alberta's Rockies]] include well-known tourist destinations [[Banff National Park]] and [[Jasper National Park]]. The two mountain parks are connected by the scenic [[Icefields Parkway]]. Banff is located {{cvt|128|km}} west of Calgary on [[Alberta Highway 1|Highway&nbsp;1]], and Jasper is located {{cvt|366|km}} west of Edmonton on [[Yellowhead Highway]].

Its [[unicameral]] legislature\u2014the [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]]\u2014consists of eighty-seven members elected [[First-past-the-post voting|first past the post]] (FPTP) from single-member constituencies.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.assembly.ab.ca/net/index.aspx?p=mla_home | title=Legislative Assembly of Alberta | work=assembly.ab.ca | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref>\n\nLocally municipal governments and school boards are elected and operate separately. Their boundaries do not necessarily coincide.\n\nAs Canada's [[head of state]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth&nbsp;II]] is the head of state for the Government of Alberta. Her duties in Alberta are carried out by Lieutenant Governor [[Lois Mitchell]]. The Queen and lieutenant governor are figureheads whose actions are highly restricted by custom and [[constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]]. The lieutenant governor handles numerous honorific duties in the name of the Queen. The government is headed by the [[Premier of Alberta|premier]]. The premier is normally a member of the Legislative Assembly, and draws all the members of the Cabinet from among the members of the Legislative Assembly. The City of Edmonton is the seat of the provincial government\u2014the capital of Alberta.\n\nThe current premier is [[Rachel Notley]], sworn in on May&nbsp;24, 2015.\n\nThe previous premier was [[Jim Prentice]], who became the leader of the then governing [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservatives]] on September 6, 2014, following the resignation of [[Alison Redford]] and the interim leadership of [[Dave Hancock]]. Prentice was sworn in as the 16th [[Premier of Alberta]] on September&nbsp;15, 2014. He called an early election on May&nbsp;5, 2015 in which the opposition [[Alberta New Democratic Party|New Democratic Party (NDP)]] won a majority of the seats. Prentice immediately resigned his seat and leadership of the PC party, but remained premier until Notley was sworn in on May&nbsp;24, 2015.\n\nAlberta's elections have tended to yield much more conservative outcomes than those of other Canadian provinces. Since the 1960s, Alberta has had three main political parties, the Progressive Conservatives (\"Conservatives\" or \"Tories\"), the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Liberals]], and the social democratic New Democrats. The [[Wildrose Party]], a more conservative party formed in early 2008, gained much support in [[2012 Alberta General Election|2012 election]] and became the [[official opposition]], a role it still holds today. The strongly conservative [[Social Credit Party of Alberta|Social Credit Party]] was a power in Alberta for many decades, but fell from the political map after the Progressive Conservatives came to power in 1971.\n\nFor 44 years the Progressive Conservatives governed Alberta. They lost the [[Alberta general election, 2015|2015 election]] to the NDP, signalling a possible shift to the left in the province, also indicated by the election of progressive mayors in both of Alberta's major cities.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/alberta/alberta-election-ndp-win-gary-mason/article24270855/ | title=An NDP victory changes everything Canadians think about Alberta | author=Gary Mason | date=May 5, 2015 | accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> Since becoming a province in 1905, Alberta has seen only four changes of government - only five parties have governed Alberta: the Liberals, from 1905 to 1921; the [[United Farmers of Alberta]], from 1921 to 1935; the Social Credit Party, from 1935 to 1971, the Progressive Conservative Party, from 1971 to 2015: and the currently governing Alberta New Democratic Party.\n\nAlberta has had occasional surges in [[Alberta separatism|separatist sentiment]]. Even during the 1980s, when these feelings were at their strongest, there has not been enough interest in secession to initiate any major movement or referendum. Several groups are currently active promoting independence for Alberta in some form.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nGovernment revenue comes mainly from royalties on non-renewable natural resources (30.4%), personal income taxes (22.3%), corporate and other taxes (19.6%), and grants from the [[Government of Canada|federal government]] primarily for infrastructure projects (9.8%).<ref name=\"budget2009\">{{cite web|title=Building On Our Strength|url=http://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2009/index.html|website=Finance Alberta|publisher=Government of Alberta|accessdate=19 May 2016}}</ref> Albertans are the lowest-taxed people in Canada, and Alberta is the only province in Canada without a provincial [[sales tax]] (but residents are still subject to the federal sales tax, the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]] of 5%).

In 1917, due to pressures of [[World War&nbsp;I]], the [[Alberta Provincial Police]] was created. This organization policed the province until it was disbanded as a [[Great Depression]] era cost cutting measure in 1932. It was at that time the now renamed [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] resumed policing of the province, specifically RCMP \"K\" Division. With the advent of the [[Alberta Sheriffs Branch]], the duties of law enforcement in Alberta has been evolving as certain aspects, such as traffic enforement, mobile surveillance and the close protection of the [[Premier of Alberta]] have been transferred to the Sheriffs. In 2006, Alberta formed the [[Alberta Law Enforcement Response Teams]] (ALERT) to combat organized crime and the serious offences that accompany it.

Alberta became Canada's second province (after [[Saskatchewan]]) to adopt a [[Tommy Douglas]]-style program in 1950, a precursor to the modern [[Medicare (Canada)|medicare]] system.\n\nAlberta's health care budget is currently $17.1&nbsp;billion during the 2013\u20132014 fiscal year (approximately 45% of all government spending), making it the best funded health care system per-capita in Canada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alberta.ca/albertaFiles/googlesearch/searchpage.aspx?q=health+funding+2013-2014+site%253Ahealth.alberta.ca&btnG=Google+Search&ud=1&output=xml_no_dtd&oe=UTF-8&ie=UTF-8&client=goa_default&proxystylesheet=goa_default&num=10&sort=date%253AD%253AL%253Ad1&wc=200&wc_mc=1&exclude_apps=1&site=pub_goa|title=Government of Alberta|date=2011-11-07|access-date=2016-09-24}}</ref> Every hour more than $1.9 million is spent on health care in the province.<ref name=\"Health Care Funding Allocations 2013\u20132014\">{{cite web | url=http://www.health.alberta.ca/about/health-funding.html | title=Health funding \u2013 Allocations for 2013\u20132014 | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[File:University Hospital Complex University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Alberta Hospital]] complex]]\nNotable health, education, research, and resources facilities in Alberta, all of which are located within Calgary or Edmonton:\n\n{{col-begin|width=600px}}\n{{col-2}}\n;Calgary\n*[[Alberta Children's Hospital]]\n*[[Foothills Medical Centre]]\n*Grace Women's Health Centre\n*[[Libin Cardiovascular Institute of Alberta]]\n*[[Peter Lougheed Centre]]\n*[[Rockyview General Hospital]]\n*[[South Health Campus]]\n*[[Tom Baker Cancer Centre]]\n*University of Calgary Medical Centre (UCMC)\n{{col-2}}\n;Edmonton\n*Alberta Diabetes Institute\n*[[Cross Cancer Institute]]\n*Edmonton Clinic\n*[[Grey Nuns Community Hospital]]\n*Lois Hole Hospital for Women\n*[[Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute]]\n*[[Misericordia Community Hospital]]\n*Rexall Centre for Pharmacy and Health Research\n*[[Royal Alexandra Hospital (Edmonton)|Royal Alexandra Hospital]]\n*[[Stollery Children's Hospital]]\n*[[University of Alberta Hospital]]\n{{col-end}}\n\nThe [[Edmonton Clinic]] complex, completed in 2012, provides a similar research, education, and care environment as the [[Mayo Clinic]] in the United States.<ref name=\"Edmonton Clinic\">{{cite web | url=http://www.edmontonclinic.ca/ | title=Edmonton Clinic | publisher=Alberta Health Services; University of Alberta | accessdate=August 31, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.edmontonsun.com/2012/12/03/30-million-donation-from-donald-kay-makes-kaye-edmonton-clinic-possible | title=$30-million donation from Donald Kaye makes Kaye Edmonton Clinic possible | last=Larson | first=Jackie | work=Edmonton Sun | date=December 3, 2012 | publisher=Sun Media | accessdate=August 17, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAll public health care services funded by the Government of Alberta are delivered operationally by [[Alberta Health Services]]. AHS is the province's single health authority established on July 1, 2008, which replaced nine local health authorities.

Since 1905 the Legislature has used this capacity to continue the model of locally elected public and separate school boards which originated prior to 1905, as well as to create and regulate universities, colleges, technical institutions and other educational forms and institutions (public charter schools, private schools, home schooling).\n\n=== Elementary schools ===\nThere are forty-two public school jurisdictions in Alberta, and seventeen operating separate school jurisdictions. Sixteen of the operating separate school jurisdictions have a Catholic electorate, and one ([[St. Albert, Alberta|St.&nbsp;Albert]]) has a [[Protestantism|Protestant]] electorate. In addition, one Protestant separate school district, Glen Avon, survives as a ward of the St. Paul Education Region. The City of Lloydminster straddles the Alberta/Saskatchewan border, and both the public and separate school systems in that city are counted in the above numbers: both of them operate according to Saskatchewan law.\n\nFor many years the provincial government has funded the greater part of the cost of providing K\u201312 education. Prior to 1994 public and separate school boards in Alberta had the legislative authority to levy a local tax on property as a supplementary support for local education. In 1994 the government of the province eliminated this right for public school boards, but not for separate school boards. Since 1994 there has continued to be a tax on property in support of K\u201312 education; the difference is that the mill rate is now set by the provincial government, the money is collected by the local municipal authority and remitted to the provincial government. The relevant legislation requires that all the money raised by this property tax must go to the support of K\u201312 education provided by school boards. The provincial government pools the property tax funds from across the province and distributes them, according to a formula, to public and separate school jurisdictions and Francophone authorities.\n\n[[Public school (government funded)|Public]] and separate school boards, [[charter school]]s, and private schools all follow the Program of Studies and the curriculum approved by the provincial department of education (Alberta Education). Homeschool tutors may choose to follow the Program of Studies or develop their own Program of Studies. Public and separate schools, charter schools, and approved private schools all employ teachers who are certificated by Alberta Education, they administer Provincial Achievement Tests and Diploma Examinations set by Alberta Education, and they may grant high school graduation certificates endorsed by Alberta Education.\n\n=== Universities ===\n{{Main article|Higher education in Alberta}}\n[[File:Saint Josephs College University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 02A.jpg|thumb|St.&nbsp;Joseph\u2019s College at the [[University of Alberta]]]]\n\nThe [[University of Alberta]], located in Edmonton and established in 1908, is Alberta's oldest and largest university. The [[University of Calgary]], once affiliated with the University of Alberta, gained its autonomy in 1966 and is now the second largest university in Alberta. [[Athabasca University]], which focuses on distance learning, and the [[University of Lethbridge]] are located in Athabasca and Lethbridge respectively.\n\nIn early September 2009, [[Mount Royal University]] became Calgary's second public university, and in late September 2009, a similar move made [[MacEwan University]] Edmonton's second public university. There are 15 colleges that receive direct public funding, along with two technical institutes, [[Northern Alberta Institute of Technology]] and [[Southern Alberta Institute of Technology]].<ref name=\"Service Centres\">{{cite web | url=https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/e927d868-7fda-4f5b-bb35-ed1b097785f2/resource/5f46b737-0a47-4a9a-b2cf-41a16b22dc20/download/5288529-2012-10-facts-on-Alberta.pdf| title=Service Centres | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref>\n\nThere is also a large and active private sector of post-secondary institutions, mostly [[List of colleges in Alberta#Private Colleges|Christian Universities]], bringing the total number of universities to twelve. Students may also receive government loans and grants while attending selected private institutions. There has been some controversy in recent years over the rising cost of post-secondary education for students (as opposed to taxpayers). In 2005, Premier [[Ralph Klein]] made a promise that he would freeze tuition and look into ways of reducing schooling costs.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.su.ualberta.ca/governance/advocacy/ |title=Advocacy | publisher=University of Alberta |accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=276&month=2&day=16&year=2005 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130810035239/http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=FrontPage&articleID=276&month=2&day=16&year=2005 | archivedate=2013-08-10 | title=Klein promises tuition freeze | last=Bellamy | first=Marshall | publisher=The Gazette | date=February 16, 2005 | accessdate=December 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{Main article|Culture of Alberta}}\n{{See also|Festivals in Alberta}}\n{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}\n\n[[File:StampedeRodeo2002.JPG|thumb|The [[Calgary Stampede]]]]\nSummer brings many festivals to the province of Alberta, especially in Edmonton. The [[Edmonton Fringe Festival]] is the world's second largest after the [[Edinburgh Festival]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton host a number of annual festivals and events, including folk music festivals. The city's \"heritage days\" festival sees the participation of over 70 ethnic groups. Edmonton's [[Churchill Square (Edmonton)|Churchill Square]] is home to a large number of the festivals, including the large Taste of Edmonton & [[The Works Art & Design Festival]] throughout the summer months.\n\nThe City of Calgary is also famous for its [[Calgary Stampede|Stampede]], dubbed \"The Greatest Outdoor Show on Earth\". The Stampede is Canada's biggest rodeo festival and features various races and competitions, such as [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]]. In line with the western tradition of rodeo are the cultural artisans that reside and create unique Alberta western heritage crafts.\n\nThe [[Banff Centre]] hosts a range of festivals and other events including the international [[Banff Mountain Film Festival|Mountain Film Festival]]. These cultural events in Alberta highlight the province's cultural diversity. Most of the major cities have several performing theatre companies who entertain in venues as diverse as Edmonton's Arts Barns and the [[Francis Winspear Centre for Music]]. Both Calgary and Edmonton are home to [[Canadian Football League]] and [[National Hockey League]] teams. Soccer, [[rugby union]] and [[lacrosse]] are also played professionally in Alberta.\n\n== Friendship partners ==\n\nAlberta has relationships with several provinces, states, and other entities worldwide.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.international.alberta.ca/554.cfm | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160409210404/http://www.international.alberta.ca/554.cfm | archivedate=2016-04-09 | title=Twinning Relationships | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=April 12, 2014}}</ref>\n\n* {{flagicon|South Korea}} [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon-do]], South Korea (1974)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://albertacanada.com/korea/images/Gangwon-AB.pdf | title=Gangwon \u2013 Alberta Relations | website=AlbertaCanada.com | publisher=Government of Alberta | accessdate=April 12, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514090614/http://www.albertacanada.com/korea/images/Gangwon-AB.pdf |archivedate=May 14, 2013 }}</ref>\n* {{flagicon|Japan}} [[Hokkaido]], Japan (1980)\n* {{flagicon|PRC}} [[Heilongjiang]], People's Republic of China (1981)\n* {{flagicon|United States}} {{flagicon|Montana}} [[Montana]], United States (1985)\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Tyumen]], Russia (1992)\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Khanty\u2013Mansi Autonomous Okrug|Khanty\u2013Mansi]], Russia (1995)\n* {{flagicon|Russia}} [[Yamalo-Nenets]], Russia (1997)\n* {{flagicon|Mexico}} {{flagicon|Jalisco}} [[Jalisco]], Mexico (1999)\n* {{flagicon|United States}} {{flagicon|Alaska}} [[Alaska]], United States (2002)\n* {{flagicon|Germany}} {{flagicon|Saxony}} [[Saxony]], Germany (2002)\n* {{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Ivano-Frankivsk]], Ukraine (2004)\n* {{flagicon|Ukraine}} [[Lviv]], Ukraine (2005)\n* {{flagicon|United States}} {{flagicon|California}} [[California]], United States (1997)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://soir.senate.ca.gov/sisterstates | title=California's Sister State Relationships | work=ca.gov | accessdate=2016-05-15}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Outline of Alberta]]\n* [[Index of Alberta-related articles]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{Cite book | last =Berry | first =Susan | author2= Jack Brink | year =2004 | title =Aboriginal Cultures in Alberta: Five Hundred Generations | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=jZjtB0gAMBwC&lpg=PP1&dq=Alberta&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true | publisher= Provincial Museum of Alberta | isbn=0-7785-2852-9 | accessdate=2012-10-21}}\n* {{Cite book | last=Cavanaugh | first=Catherine Anne | author2=Michael Payne | author3=Donald Wetherell | author4= Catherine Cavanaugh\n | year =2006 | title =Alberta formed, Alberta transformed, Volume 1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_XNCXJcjlkC&lpg=PP1&dq=Alberta&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true | publisher=University of Alberta Press | isbn=1-55238-194-3 | accessdate=2012-10-21 }}\n* {{Cite book | last =Connors | first=Richard | first2=John M. | last2=Law | year =2005 | title =Forging Alberta's constitutional framework | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=fH8e7dOAWPgC&lpg=PP3&dq=Alberta&pg=PP3#v=onepage&q&f=true | publisher=University of Alberta \u2013 Centre for Constitutional Studies | isbn=0-88864-457-4 | accessdate=2012-10-21 }}\n* {{Cite book | last =Holt | first =Faye Reineberg | year =2009 | title =Alberta: A History in Photographs\n | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Lgy0_OaTZWYC&lpg=PP1&dq=Alberta&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=true | publisher=Heritage House ;

This led him to develop his [[special theory of relativity]] during his time at the [[Swiss Patent Office]] in [[Bern]] (1902\u20131909), Switzerland. However, he realized that the principle of relativity could also be extended to [[gravitational fields]] and\u2014with his subsequent theory of gravitation in 1916\u2014he published a paper on [[general relativity]]. He continued to deal with problems of [[statistical mechanics]] and quantum theory, which led to his explanations of [[particle]] theory and the [[Brownian motion|motion of molecules]]. He also investigated the thermal properties of light which laid the foundation of the [[photon]] theory of light. In 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to model the large-scale structure of the [[universe]].<ref name=Nobel>{{Citation |url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2011/advanced-physicsprize2011.pdf |title=Scientific Background on the Nobel Prize in Physics 2011.

At the age of 8, he was transferred to the [[Luitpold Gymnasium]] (now known as the Albert Einstein Gymnasium), where he received advanced primary and secondary school education until he left the [[German Empire]] seven years later.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA59 59\u201361]}}\n\nIn 1894, Hermann and Jakob's company lost a bid to supply the city of Munich with electrical lighting because they lacked the capital to convert their equipment from the direct current (DC) standard to the more efficient [[alternating current]] (AC) standard.<ref>Barry R. Parker, Einstein: The Passions of a Scientist, Prometheus Books \u2013 2003, page 31</ref> The loss forced the sale of the Munich factory. In search of business, the Einstein family moved to Italy, first to [[Milan]] and a few months later to [[Pavia]]. When the family moved to Pavia, Einstein stayed in Munich to finish his studies at the Luitpold Gymnasium. His father intended for him to pursue [[electrical engineering]], but Einstein clashed with authorities and resented the school's regimen and teaching method. He later wrote that the spirit of learning and creative thought was lost in strict [[rote learning]]. At the end of December 1894, he travelled to Italy to join his family in Pavia, convincing the school to let him go by using a doctor's note.{{Sfnp|F\u00f6lsing|1997|pp=30\u201331}} During his time in Italy he wrote a short essay with the title \"On the Investigation of the State of the [[Aether theories|Ether]] in a Magnetic Field\".{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 1 (1987), doc. 5}}<ref>{{Citation |last=Mehra |first=Jagdish |contribution=Albert Einstein's first paper |title=The Golden Age of Physics |publisher=World Scientific |date=2001 |isbn=981-02-4985-3}}</ref>\n\nIn 1895, at the age of 16, Einstein took the entrance examinations for the [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Polytechnic]] in [[Z\u00fcrich]] (later the Eidgen\u00f6ssische Technische Hochschule, ETH).

While lodging with the family of professor Jost Winteler, he fell in love with Winteler's daughter, Marie.

She was the only woman among the six students in the mathematics and physics section of the teaching diploma course. Over the next few years, Einstein and Mari\u0107's friendship developed into romance, and they read books together on extra-curricular physics in which Einstein was taking an increasing interest.

It was published in 1901 with the title \"Folgerungen aus den Capillarit\u00e4tserscheinungen\", which translates as \"Conclusions from the capillarity phenomena\". Two papers he published in 1902\u20131903 (thermodynamics) attempted to interpret [[atom]]ic phenomena from a statistical point of view. These papers were the foundation for the 1905 paper on Brownian motion, which showed that Brownian movement can be construed as firm evidence that molecules exist. His research in 1903 and 1904 was mainly concerned with the effect of finite atomic size on diffusion phenomena.<ref name=PubList />\n\n=== General principles ===\nHe articulated the [[principle of relativity]]. This was understood by [[Hermann Minkowski]] to be a generalization of rotational invariance from space to space-time. Other principles postulated by Einstein and later vindicated are the [[principle of equivalence]], [[general covariance]] and the principle of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of the quantum number.\n\n=== Theory of relativity and ''E'' = ''mc''\u00b2 ===\n{{Main article|History of special relativity}}\nEinstein's \"''Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper''\" (\"On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies\") was received on 30 June 1905 and published 26 September of that same year. It reconciles [[Maxwell's equations]] for electricity and magnetism with the laws of mechanics, by introducing major changes to mechanics close to the [[speed of light]]. This later became known as Einstein's special theory of relativity.\n\nConsequences of this include the [[Spacetime|time\u2013space frame]] of a moving body appearing to [[Time dilation|slow down]] and [[Length contraction|contract]] (in the direction of motion) when measured in the frame of the observer. This paper also argued that the idea of a [[luminiferous aether]]\u2014one of the leading theoretical entities in physics at the time\u2014was superfluous.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905d}}\n\nIn his paper on [[mass\u2013energy equivalence]], Einstein produced ''E''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''mc''<sup>2</sup> from his special relativity equations.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2002|pp=vi, 15, 90, 131, [https://books.google.com/?id=OAsQ_hFjhrAC&pg=PA215 215]}} Einstein's 1905 work on relativity remained controversial for many years, but was accepted by leading physicists, starting with [[Max Planck]].<ref>For a discussion of the reception of relativity theory around the world, and the different controversies it encountered, see the articles in Thomas F. Glick, ed., ''The Comparative Reception of Relativity'' (Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1987), {{ISBN|90-277-2498-9}}.</ref>{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=382\u2013386}}\n\n=== Photons and energy quanta ===\n[[File:Photoelectric effect.svg|thumb|upright|The photoelectric effect. Incoming photons on the left strike a metal plate (bottom), and eject electrons, depicted as flying off to the right.]]\n{{Main article|Photon|Quantum}}\nIn a 1905 paper,{{Sfnp|Einstein|1905a}} Einstein postulated that light itself consists of localized particles (''[[quantum|quanta]]''). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with [[Robert Millikan]]'s detailed experiments on the photoelectric effect, and with the measurement of [[Compton scattering]].\n\nEinstein concluded that each wave of frequency ''f'' is associated with a collection of [[photon]]s with energy ''hf'' each, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]]. He does not say much more, because he is not sure how the particles are related to the wave. But he does suggest that this idea would explain certain experimental results, notably the photoelectric effect.{{sfnp|Einstein|1905a}}\n\n=== Quantized atomic vibrations ===\n{{Main article|Einstein solid}}\nIn 1907, Einstein proposed a model of matter where each atom in a lattice structure is an independent harmonic oscillator. In the Einstein model, each atom oscillates independently\u2014a series of equally spaced quantized states for each oscillator. Einstein was aware that getting the frequency of the actual oscillations would be difficult, but he nevertheless proposed this theory because it was a particularly clear demonstration that quantum mechanics could solve the specific heat problem in classical mechanics. [[Peter Debye]] refined this model.<ref>[http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/nuggets/einstein/solidcolda.html Celebrating Einstein \"Solid Cold\". U.S. DOE.], [[Office of Scientific and Technical Information]], 2011.</ref>\n\n=== Adiabatic principle and action-angle variables ===\n{{Main article|Old quantum theory}}\nThroughout the 1910s, quantum mechanics expanded in scope to cover many different systems. After [[Ernest Rutherford]] discovered the nucleus and proposed that electrons orbit like planets, Niels Bohr was able to show that the same quantum mechanical postulates introduced by Planck and developed by Einstein would explain the discrete motion of electrons in atoms, and the [[periodic table of the elements]].\n\nEinstein contributed to these developments by linking them with the 1898 arguments [[Wilhelm Wien]] had made. Wien had shown that the hypothesis of [[adiabatic invariant|adiabatic invariance]] of a thermal equilibrium state allows all the [[blackbody radiation|blackbody curves]] at different temperature to be derived from one another by a [[Wien's displacement law|simple shifting process]]. Einstein noted in 1911 that the same adiabatic principle shows that the quantity which is quantized in any mechanical motion must be an adiabatic invariant. [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] identified this adiabatic invariant as the [[action-angle variables|action variable]] of classical mechanics.\n\n=== Wave\u2013particle duality ===\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1921.jpg|thumb|upright|Einstein during his visit to the United States]]\n{{Main article|Wave\u2013particle duality}}\nAlthough the patent office promoted Einstein to Technical Examiner Second Class in 1906, he had not given up on academia. In 1908, he became a ''[[Privatdozent]]'' at the University of Bern.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|p=522}} In \"''\u00dcber die Entwicklung unserer Anschauungen \u00fcber das Wesen und die Konstitution der Strahlung''\" (\"[[s:The Development of Our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation|The Development of our Views on the Composition and Essence of Radiation]]\"), on the [[quantization (physics)|quantization]] of light, and in an earlier 1909 paper, Einstein showed that Max Planck's energy quanta must have well-defined [[momentum|momenta]] and act in some respects as independent, [[point particle|point-like particles]]. This paper introduced the ''photon'' concept (although the name ''photon'' was introduced later by [[Gilbert N. Lewis]] in 1926) and inspired the notion of [[wave\u2013particle duality]] in [[quantum mechanics]]. Einstein saw this wave\u2013particle duality in radiation as concrete evidence for his conviction that physics needed a new, unified foundation.\n\n=== Theory of critical opalescence ===\n{{Main article|Critical opalescence}}\nEinstein returned to the problem of thermodynamic fluctuations, giving a treatment of the density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy with respect to the density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to [[Rayleigh scattering]], which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue.<ref>{{cite web |last=Levenson |first=Thomas |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/einstein/genius/ |title=Einstein's Big Idea |publisher=WBGH |type=public broadcaster website |via=NOVA by [[Public Broadcasting Service]] (PBS), Arlington, VA, USA |location=Boston, MA, USA |date=9 September 1997 |accessdate=2015-06-20}}</ref> Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.\n\n=== Zero-point energy ===\n{{Main article|Zero-point energy}}\nIn a series of works completed from 1911 to 1913, Planck reformulated his 1900 quantum theory and introduced the idea of zero-point energy in his \"second quantum theory\". Soon, this idea attracted the attention of Einstein and his assistant [[Otto Stern]]. Assuming the energy of rotating diatomic molecules contains zero-point energy, they then compared the theoretical specific heat of hydrogen gas with the experimental data. The numbers matched nicely. However, after publishing the findings, they promptly withdrew their support, because they no longer had confidence in the correctness of the idea of zero-point energy.{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 4: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1912\u20131914|pp=270ff}}\n\n=== General relativity and the equivalence principle ===\n{{Main article|History of general relativity}}\n{{See also|Principle of equivalence|Theory of relativity|Einstein field equations}}\n[[File:1919 eclipse positive.jpg|alt=Black circle covering the sun, rays visible around it, in a dark sky.|thumb|upright|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington|Eddington]]'s photograph of a [[solar eclipse]]]]\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a [[theory of gravitation]] that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to [[general relativity]], the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping of [[spacetime|space and time]] by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern [[astrophysics]]. It provides the foundation for the current understanding of [[black holes]], regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.\n\nAs Einstein later said, the reason for the development of general relativity was that the preference of inertial motions within [[special relativity]] was unsatisfactory, while a theory which from the outset prefers no state of motion (even accelerated ones) should appear more satisfactory.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1923}} Consequently, in 1907 he published an article on acceleration under special relativity. In that article titled \"On the Relativity Principle and the Conclusions Drawn from It\", he argued that [[free fall]] is really inertial motion, and that for a free-falling observer the rules of special relativity must apply. This argument is called the [[equivalence principle]]. In the same article, Einstein also predicted the phenomena of [[gravitational time dilation]], [[gravitational red shift]] and [[Gravitational lensing|deflection of light]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=179\u2013183}}{{Sfnp|Stachel|2008|loc=vol. 2: The Swiss Years: Writings, 1900\u20131909|pp=273\u2013274}}\n\nIn 1911, Einstein published another article \"On the Influence of Gravitation on the Propagation of Light\" expanding on the 1907 article, in which he estimated the amount of deflection of light by massive bodies. Thus, the theoretical prediction of general relativity can for the first time be tested experimentally.{{Sfnp|Pais|1982|pp=194\u2013195}}\n\n====Gravitational waves====\nIn 1916, Einstein predicted [[gravitational wave]]s,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=N\u00e4herungsweise Integration der Feldgleichungen der Gravitation |date= June 1916 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=[[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin]] |volume=part 1|pages=688\u2013696}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|author=Einstein, A |title=\u00dcber Gravitationswellen |date=1918 |url=http://einstein-annalen.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/related_texts/sitzungsberichte |journal=Sitzungsberichte der K\u00f6niglich Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften Berlin|volume=part 1|pages=154\u2013167}}</ref> ripples in the [[curvature]] of spacetime which propagate as [[wave]]s, traveling outward from the source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation.

He formulated an argument that led him to conclude that a general relativistic field theory is impossible. He gave up looking for fully generally covariant tensor equations, and searched for equations that would be invariant under general linear transformations only.\n\nIn June 1913, the Entwurf (\"draft\") theory was the result of these investigations. As its name suggests, it was a sketch of a theory, less elegant and more difficult than general relativity, with the equations of motion supplemented by additional gauge fixing conditions. After more than two years of intensive work, Einstein realized that the [[hole argument]] was mistaken<ref>van Dongen, Jeroen (2010) ''Einstein's Unification'' Cambridge University Press, p.23.</ref> and abandoned the theory in November 1915.\n\n=== Physical Cosmology ===\n{{Main article|Physical Cosmology}}\n{{cosmology|scientists}}\nIn 1917, Einstein applied the general theory of relativity to the structure of the universe as a whole.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917a}} He discovered that the general field equations predicted a universe that was dynamic, either contracting or expanding. As observational evidence for a dynamic universe was not known at the time, Einstein introduced a new term, the [[cosmological constant]], to the field equations, in order to allow the theory to predict a static universe. The modified field equations predicted a static universe of closed curvature, in accordance with Einstein's understanding of [[Mach's principle]] in these years. This model became known as the Einstein World or [[Einstein's static universe]].{{Sfnp|Pais|1994|pp=285\u2013286}} <ref>{{cite book|last1=North|first1=J.D.|title=The Measure of the Universe: A History of Modern Cosmology|date=1965|publisher=Dover|location=New York|pages=81\u201383}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the discovery of the recession of the nebulae by [[Edwin Hubble]] in 1929, Einstein abandoned his static model of the universe, and proposed two dynamic models of the cosmos, [[The Friedmann-Einstein universe]] of 1931<ref name=\"einstein-1931\">Einstein, A. 1931.

Video.pbs.org. Retrieved on 11 May 2012.</ref> In 1917, at the height of his work on relativity, Einstein published an article in ''Physikalische Zeitschrift'' that proposed the possibility of [[stimulated emission]], the physical process that makes possible the [[maser]] and the [[laser]].{{Sfnp|Einstein|1917b}}\nThis article showed that the statistics of absorption and emission of light would only be consistent with Planck's distribution law if the emission of light into a mode with n photons would be enhanced statistically compared to the emission of light into an empty mode. This paper was enormously influential in the later development of quantum mechanics, because it was the first paper to show that the statistics of atomic transitions had simple laws. Einstein discovered [[Louis de Broglie]]'s work, and supported his ideas, which were received skeptically at first. In another major paper from this era, Einstein gave a wave equation for [[Matter wave|de Broglie waves]], which Einstein suggested was the [[Hamilton\u2013Jacobi equation]] of mechanics. This paper would inspire Schr\u00f6dinger's work of 1926.\n\n=== Bose\u2013Einstein statistics ===\n{{Main article|Bose\u2013Einstein statistics}}\nIn 1924, Einstein received a description of a [[statistical mechanics|statistical]] model from Indian physicist [[Satyendra Nath Bose]], based on a counting method that assumed that light could be understood as a gas of indistinguishable particles. Einstein noted that Bose's statistics applied to some atoms as well as to the proposed light particles, and submitted his translation of Bose's paper to the ''[[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physik]]''. Einstein also published his own articles describing the model and its implications, among them the [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate]] phenomenon that some particulates should appear at very low temperatures.{{Sfnp|Einstein|1924}} It was not until 1995 that the first such condensate was produced experimentally by [[Eric Allin Cornell]] and [[Carl Wieman]] using [[ultracold atom|ultra-cooling]] equipment built at the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]]\u2013[[JILA]] laboratory at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]].<ref>{{Citation|url=https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |title=Cornell and Wieman Share 2001 Nobel Prize in Physics |date=9 October 2001 |accessdate=11 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070610080506/https://www.nist.gov/public_affairs/releases/n01-04.htm |archivedate=10 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}</ref> Bose\u2013Einstein statistics are now used to describe the behaviors of any assembly of [[boson]]s. Einstein's sketches for this project may be seen in the Einstein Archive in the library of the Leiden University.<ref name=Instituut-Lorentz />\n\n=== Energy momentum pseudotensor ===\n{{Main article|Stress\u2013energy\u2013momentum pseudotensor}}\nGeneral relativity includes a dynamical spacetime, so it is difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. [[Noether's theorem]] allows these quantities to be determined from a [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] with [[Translational symmetry|translation invariance]], but [[general covariance]] makes translation invariance into something of a [[gauge symmetry]]. The energy and momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.\n\nEinstein argued that this is true for fundamental reasons, because the gravitational field could be made to vanish by a choice of coordinates. He maintained that the non-covariant energy momentum pseudotensor was in fact the best description of the energy momentum distribution in a gravitational field. This approach has been echoed by [[Lev Landau]] and [[Evgeny Lifshitz]], and others, and has become standard.\n\nThe use of non-covariant objects like pseudotensors was heavily criticized in 1917 by [[Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger]] and others.\n\n=== Unified field theory ===\n{{Main article|Classical unified field theories}}\nFollowing his research on general relativity, Einstein entered into a series of attempts to generalize his geometric theory of gravitation to include electromagnetism as another aspect of a single entity. In 1950, he described his \"[[unified field theory]]\" in a ''[[Scientific American]]'' article titled \"On the Generalized Theory of Gravitation\".{{Sfnp|Einstein|1950}} Although he continued to be lauded for his work, Einstein became increasingly isolated in his research, and his efforts were ultimately unsuccessful.\nIn his pursuit of a unification of the fundamental forces, Einstein ignored some mainstream developments in physics, most notably the [[strong nuclear force|strong]] and [[weak nuclear force]]s, which were not well understood until many years after his death. Mainstream physics, in turn, largely ignored Einstein's approaches to unification. Einstein's dream of unifying other laws of physics with gravity motivates modern quests for a [[theory of everything]] and in particular [[string theory]], where geometrical fields emerge in a unified quantum-mechanical setting.\n\n=== Wormholes ===\n{{Main article|Wormhole}}\nIn 1935, Einstein collaborated with [[Nathan Rosen]] to produce a model of a [[wormhole]], often called [[Einstein\u2013Rosen bridges]].<ref>{{cite journal |author=Einstein, Albert |author2=Rosen, Nathan |last-author-amp=yes |date=1935 |title=The Particle Problem in the General Theory of Relativity |journal=[[Physical Review]] |volume=48 |page=73 |doi=10.1103/PhysRev.48.73 |bibcode=1935PhRv...48...73E}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=2015 \u2013 General Relativity\u2019s Centennial|publisher=[[American Physical Society]]|date=2015|url=https://journals.aps.org/general-relativity-centennial|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref> His motivation was to model elementary particles with charge as a solution of gravitational field equations, in line with the program outlined in the paper \"Do Gravitational Fields play an Important Role in the Constitution of the Elementary Particles?\". These solutions cut and pasted [[Schwarzschild black hole]]s to make a bridge between two patches.<ref>{{cite web|title=Focus: The Birth of Wormholes|author=David Lindley|url=https://physics.aps.org/story/v15/st11|publisher=American Physical Society|date=25 March 2005|accessdate=7 April 2017}}</ref>\n\nIf one end of a wormhole was positively charged, the other end would be negatively charged. These properties led Einstein to believe that pairs of particles and antiparticles could be described in this way.\n\n=== Einstein\u2013Cartan theory ===\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013Cartan theory}}\n[[File:Albert Einstein photo 1920.jpg|alt=Einstein, sitting at a table, looks up from the papers he is reading and into the camera.|thumb|upright|Einstein at his office, [[University of Berlin]], 1920]]In order to incorporate spinning point particles into general relativity, the affine connection needed to be generalized to include an antisymmetric part, called the [[Torsion tensor|torsion]]. This modification was made by Einstein and Cartan in the 1920s.\n\n=== Equations of motion ===\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013Infeld\u2013Hoffmann equations}}\nThe theory of general relativity has a fundamental law\u2014the [[Einstein equations]] which describe how space curves, the [[geodesic equation]] which describes how particles move may be derived from the Einstein equations.\n\nSince the equations of general relativity are non-linear, a lump of energy made out of pure gravitational fields, like a black hole, would move on a trajectory which is determined by the Einstein equations themselves, not by a new law. So Einstein proposed that the path of a singular solution, like a black hole, would be determined to be a geodesic from general relativity itself.\n\nThis was established by Einstein, Infeld, and Hoffmann for pointlike objects without angular momentum, and by [[Roy Kerr]] for spinning objects.\n\n=== Other investigations ===\n{{Main article|Einstein's unsuccessful investigations}}\nEinstein conducted other investigations that were unsuccessful and abandoned. These pertain to [[force]], [[superconductivity]], and other research.\n\n=== Collaboration with other scientists ===\n[[File:Solvay conference 1927.jpg|thumb|The 1927 [[Solvay Conference]] in Brussels, a gathering of the world's top physicists. Einstein is in the center.]]\nIn addition to longtime collaborators [[Leopold Infeld]], [[Nathan Rosen]], [[Peter Bergmann]] and others, Einstein also had some one-shot collaborations with various scientists.\n\n==== Einstein\u2013de Haas experiment ====\n{{Main article|Einstein\u2013de Haas effect}}\nEinstein and De Haas demonstrated that magnetization is due to the motion of electrons, nowadays known to be the spin. In order to show this, they reversed the magnetization in an iron bar suspended on a [[torsion pendulum]]. They confirmed that this leads the bar to rotate, because the electron's angular momentum changes as the magnetization changes. This experiment needed to be sensitive, because the angular momentum associated with electrons is small, but it definitively established that electron motion of some kind is responsible for magnetization.\n\n==== Schr\u00f6dinger gas model ====\nEinstein suggested to Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger that he might be able to reproduce the statistics of a [[Bose\u2013Einstein condensate|Bose\u2013Einstein gas]] by considering a box. Then to each possible quantum motion of a particle in a box associate an independent harmonic oscillator. Quantizing these oscillators, each level will have an integer occupation number, which will be the number of particles in it.\n\nThis formulation is a form of [[second quantization]], but it predates modern quantum mechanics. Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger applied this to derive the [[thermodynamic]] properties of a [[Quantum chaos|semiclassical]] [[ideal gas]]. Schr\u00f6dinger urged Einstein to add his name as co-author, although Einstein declined the invitation.<ref>{{Citation |last=Moore |first=Walter |date=1989 |title=Schr\u00f6dinger: Life and Thought |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-43767-9}}</ref>\n\n==== Einstein refrigerator ====\n{{Main article|Einstein refrigerator}}\nIn 1926, Einstein and his former student Le\u00f3 Szil\u00e1rd co-invented (and in 1930, patented) the [[Einstein refrigerator]].

He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without disturbing it in any way.\n\nHe then used a hypothesis of [[local realism]] to conclude that the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way disturbing the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.\n\nThis principle distilled the essence of Einstein's objection to quantum mechanics. As a physical principle, it was shown to be incorrect when the [[Aspect experiment]] of 1982 confirmed [[Bell's theorem]], which had been promulgated in 1964.\n\n== Non-scientific legacy ==\nWhile traveling, Einstein wrote daily to his wife Elsa and adopted stepdaughters Margot and Ilse.

In the late 19th century, Afghanistan became a [[buffer state]] in the \"[[The Great Game|Great Game]]\" between [[British Raj|British India]] and the [[Russian Empire]]. Following the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] in 1919, [[Amanullah Khan|King Amanullah]] unsuccessfully attempted to modernize the country. Afghanistan remained peaceful during [[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah's]] forty years of monarchy. A series of coups in the 1970s was followed by a [[War in Afghanistan (1978\u2013present)|series of civil wars]] that devastated much of Afghanistan which began when the country [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|became a socialist state]] under the influence of the [[Soviet Union]] during the [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War]]. Following the [[Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan|departure of the Soviet forces]], the country became an [[Islamic State of Afghanistan|Islamic state]] under the [[Peshawar Accord]] but much of its territory was then held by the [[Islamism|Islamic supremacist]] group the [[Taliban]], who ruled the country as a [[Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan|totalitarian regime for almost five years]]. Following the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]] in the [[United States]], the Taliban was [[Battle of Tora Bora|forcibly removed]] by the [[NATO]]-[[International Security Assistance Force|led coalition]], Afghanistan's previous political structure was replaced with a more [[Western world|pro-Western]], democratically-elected government.\n\nAfghanistan is a [[unitary state|unitary]] [[presidential system|presidential]] [[Islamic republic]] with [[Islam in Afghanistan|Islam]] as an official [[state religion]].

In the mid-to-late first century CE the vast [[Kushan Empire]], centered in Afghanistan, became great patrons of Buddhist culture, making [[Buddhism]] flourish throughout the region. The Kushans were overthrown by the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]] in the 3rd century CE, though the [[Indo-Sassanids]] continued to rule at least parts of the region.

In 1878, the  [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] was fought over perceived Russian influence, [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] replaced [[Mohammad Ayub Khan (Emir of Afghanistan)|Ayub Khan]], and Britain gained control of Afghanistan's [[foreign policy|foreign relations]] as part of the [[Treaty of Gandamak]] of 1879. In 1893, [[Mortimer Durand]] made Amir Abdur Rahman Khan sign a controversial agreement in which the ethnic [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] territories were divided by the [[Durand Line]]. This was a standard [[divide and rule]] policy of the British and would lead to strained relations, especially with the later new state of Pakistan.\n[[File:Zahir Shah of Afghanistan in 1930s-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Mohammed Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], the last king of Afghanistan, who reigned from 1933 to 1973.]]\nAfter the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]] and the signing of the [[Anglo-Afghan Treaty of 1919|Treaty of Rawalpindi]] on 19 August 1919, King [[Am\u0101null\u0101h Kh\u0101n|Amanullah Khan]] declared Afghanistan a [[sovereign state|sovereign]] and fully [[independence|independent state]]. He moved to end his country's traditional isolation by establishing diplomatic relations with the international community and, following a 1927\u201328 tour of Europe and [[Turkey]], introduced several reforms intended to modernize his nation. A key force behind these reforms was [[Mahmud Tarzi]], an ardent supporter of the education of women. He fought for Article 68 of Afghanistan's 1923 [[constitution of Afghanistan|constitution]], which made elementary education compulsory. The institution of [[slavery]] was abolished in 1923.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1976| volume = Volume 25| encyclopedia = [[Encyclopedia Americana]]|publisher=Americana Corporation | page = 24 }}</ref>\n\nSome of the reforms that were actually put in place, such as the abolition of the traditional [[burqa]] for women and the opening of a number of co-educational schools, quickly alienated many tribal and religious leaders. Faced with overwhelming armed opposition, Amanullah Khan was forced to abdicate in January 1929 after Kabul fell to rebel forces led by [[Habibullah Kalakani]]. Prince [[Mohammed Nadir Shah]], Amanullah's cousin, in turn defeated and killed Kalakani in November 1929, and was declared King Nadir Shah. He abandoned the reforms of Amanullah Khan in favor of a more gradual approach to modernisation but was assassinated in 1933 by [[Abdul Khaliq Hazara (assassin)|Abdul Khaliq]], a fifteen-year-old [[Hazara people|Hazara]] student.\n\n[[Mohammed Zahir Shah]], Nadir Shah's 19-year-old son, succeeded to the throne and reigned from 1933 to 1973. Until 1946, Zahir Shah ruled with the assistance of his uncle, who held the post of [[Prime Minister of Afghanistan|Prime Minister]] and continued the policies of Nadir Shah. Another of Zahir Shah's uncles, [[Shah Mahmud Khan]], became Prime Minister in 1946 and began an experiment allowing greater political freedom, but reversed the policy when it went further than he expected. He was replaced in 1953 by [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the king's cousin and brother-in-law. Daoud Khan sought a closer relationship with the [[Soviet Union]] and a more distant one towards Pakistan. Afghanistan remained neutral and was neither a participant in [[World War II]] nor aligned with either power bloc in the [[Cold War]]. However, it was a beneficiary of the latter rivalry as both the Soviet Union and the United States vied for influence by building Afghanistan's main highways, airports, and other vital infrastructure. On per capita basis, Afghanistan received more Soviet [[development aid]] than any other country. In 1973, while King Zahir Shah was on an official overseas visit, Daoud Khan launched a bloodless coup and became the first [[President of Afghanistan]]. In the meantime, [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] got neighboring Pakistan involved in Afghanistan. Some experts suggest that Bhutto paved the way for the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]].<ref name=\"Bowersox\">{{cite book\n |title=The Gem Hunter: The Adventures of an American in Afghanistan\n |last1=Bowersox\n |first1=Gary W.\n |quote=To launch this plan, Bhutto recruited and trained a group of Afghans in the [[Bala Hissar, Peshawar|Bala-Hesar]] of [[Peshawar]], in Pakistan's [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|North-west Frontier Province]].

The process of Islamization was an incremental one, commencing from the arrival of the Ottomans in the 14th century (to this day, a minority of Albanians are Catholic or Orthodox Christians, though the vast majority became Muslim). [[Timar]] holders, the bedrock of early Ottoman control in southeast Europe, were not necessarily converts to Islam, and occasionally rebelled; the most famous of these rebels is [[Skanderbeg]] (his figure would rise up later on, in the 19th century, as a central component of the Albanian national identity).

The coastal lowlands have typically [[mediterranean climate]]; the highlands have a [[Continental climate|mediterranean continental climate]].

Average summer temperatures are lower than in the coastal areas and much lower at higher elevations, but daily fluctuations are greater. Daytime maximum temperatures in the interior basins and river valleys are very high, but the nights are almost always cool. Average [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] is heavy, a result of the convergence of the prevailing airflow from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the continental air mass.[[File:Maja e That\u00eb (2406 m) in the Albanian Alps.jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Subarctic climate]] on [[Albanian Alps]]. {{legend|#007E7D}}]] Because they usually meet at the point where the terrain rises, the heaviest rain falls in the central uplands. Vertical currents initiated when the Mediterranean air is uplifted also cause frequent thunderstorms. Many of these storms are accompanied by high local winds and torrential downpours. When the continental air mass is weak, Mediterranean winds drop their moisture farther inland. When there is a dominant continental air mass, cold air spills onto the lowland areas, which occurs most frequently in the winter. Because the season's lower temperatures damage olive trees and citrus fruits, groves and orchards are restricted to sheltered places with southern and western exposures, even in areas with high average winter temperatures.

After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories.\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width =240\n |image1 = Fan Stilian Noli.jpg\n |width1 = 610 |height1 =\n |image2 = Clement XI.jpg\n |width2 =  500 |height2 =\n |footer = [[Fan S.

The northern and southern traditions are contrasted by the rugged and heroic tone of the north and the relaxed form of the south. \nThe [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]s are known for a distinctive variety of sung epic poetry. Many of the songs are about the ancient history of the Albanians but also the Albanian medieval hero [[Skanderbeg]], who led the struggle against the Turks, and the constant Albanian themes of honour, hospitality, treachery and revenge. [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] music is soft and gentle, and polyphonic in nature. South Albania is also known for funeral laments with a chorus and one to two soloists with overlapping, mournful voices. Its instrumental music includes the sedate kaba, an ensemble-driven by a clarinet or violin alongside accordions and lahut\u00ebs. The kaba is an improvised and melancholic style with melodies that Kim Burton describes as \"both fresh and ancient\", \"ornamented with swoops, glides and growls of an almost vocal quality\", exemplifying the \"combination of passion with restraint that is the hallmark of Albanian culture.\"\n\nThese disparate styles are unified by the intensity that both performers and listeners give to their music as a medium for patriotic expression and as a vehicle carrying the narrative of [[oral history]], as well as certain characteristics like the use of rhythms such as 3/8, 5/8 and 10/8.<ref>Arbatsky, Yuri, cited in Koco with the footnote ''Translated and published by Filip Fishta in Shkolla Komb\u00ebtare (The National School; No.1, May 1939), 19, and quoted from his Preface to [[Pjet\u00ebr Dungu]]'s Lyra Shqiptare (see note 2).''</ref> The first compilation of Albanian folk music was made by two [[Himara|Himariot]] song artists [[Ne\u00e7o Muko|Ne\u00e7o Muka]] and Ko\u00e7o \u00c7akali in 1929 and 1931 in [[Paris]] during their interpretations with the Albanian song diva Tefta Tashko Ko\u00e7o.

Albanian earliest icons date from the late thirteenth century and generally estimated that their artistic peak reached in the eighteenth century. Among the most prominent representatives of the Albanian iconographic art were [[Onufri]] and [[David Selenica]].

(Illyrian and Daco-Thracian, however, might have been closely related languages; see [[Thraco-Illyrian]].)\n\nThe cultural renaissance was first of all expressed through the development of the [[Albanian language]] in the area of church texts and publications, mainly of the Catholic region in the northern of Albania, but also of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] in the south. The Protestant reforms invigorated hopes for the development of the local language and literary tradition, when cleric [[Gjon Buzuku]] brought into the Albanian language the [[Catholic liturgy]], trying to do for the Albanian language, what [[Martin Luther]] did for the [[German language]].\n\n[[Meshari]] (''The Missal'') written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] was published in 1555 and is considered as one of the first literary work of written Albanian during the Middle Ages. The refined level of the language and the stabilised orthography must be the result of an earlier tradition of written Albanian, a tradition that is not well understood. However, there is some fragmented evidence, pre-dating Buzuku, which indicates that Albanian was written from at least the 14th century.\nThe earliest evidence dates from 1332&nbsp;AD with a Latin report from the French Dominican Guillelmus Adae, [[Archbishop]] of [[Antivari]], who wrote that Albanians used Latin letters in their books although their language was quite different from Latin. Other significant examples include: a [[Formula e pag\u00ebzimit|baptism formula]] (''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et spertit senit'') from 1462, written in Albanian within a Latin text by the Bishop of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Pal Engj\u00eblli]]; a glossary of Albanian words of 1497 by Arnold von Harff, a German who had travelled through Albania, and a 15th-century fragment of the Bible from the [[Gospel of Matthew]], also in Albanian, but written in Greek letters.\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width = 240\n\n |image1   = NaumVeqilharxhi.jpg\n |width1   = 189\n |caption1 = [[Naum Veqilharxhi]] lawyer and scholar <small>(1797\u20131854)</small>\n\n |image2   = Parashqevi-qirjazi_152_186.jpg\n |width2   = 208\n |caption2 = [[Parashqevi Qiriazi]] teacher and feminist <small>(1880\u20131970)</small>\n}}\n\nAlbanian writings from these centuries must not have been religious texts only, but historical chronicles too.

Some conservative old men and women mainly from the high Northern as well as Southern Lands and wear traditional clothing in their daily lives. The clothing was made mainly of products from the local agriculture and livestock such as leather, wool, linen, hemp fiber and silk. Today, the Albanian traditional textiles are still embroidered in very claborate ancient patterns.\nAmong the most important parts of clothing includes the [[Qeleshe]] (''Plis)'', the [[Albanian hat]], the Qylaf\u00eb, the [[Fustanella]], the [[Xhubleta]], the [[Xhamadan]], the [[Brez (clothing)|Brez]], the [[\u00c7orape]], the [[Opinga]] and others.\n\n=== Cuisine ===\n{{Main|Albanian cuisine}}\n{{See|Albanian wine}}\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width = 240\n |image1 =F\u00ebrges\u00eb dhe Tav\u00eb me oriz.jpg\n |width1 = 900 |height1 =\n |image2 =Cannolo siciliano with chocolate squares.jpg\n |width2 =  1000 |height2 =\n |footer = [[Albanian cuisine|Tav\u00eb me oriz]] a traditional meal served in an oven-baked clay bowl. <small>('''left''')</small>  Cannoli is very popular in [[Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb people|Arb\u00ebresh\u00eb Regions]]. <small>('''right''')</small>}}\nThe Cuisine of Albania&nbsp;\u2013 as with most [[Mediterranean]] and [[Balkans|Balkan]] nations&nbsp;\u2013 is strongly influenced by its long history. At different times, the territory which is now Albania has been claimed or occupied by [[Ancient Greece]], [[Roman Empire|Romans]], Byzantine and the [[Ottoman Turk]]s and each group has left its mark on Albanian cuisine.\n\nThe main meal of [[Albanians]] is the midday meal, which is usually accompanied by a [[salad]] of fresh vegetables such as tomatoes, [[cucumber]]s, green [[bell pepper|peppers]] and [[olive]]s with [[olive oil]], vinegar and salt. It also includes a main dish of vegetables and meat. Though it is used in several dishes, pumpkins are more commonly displayed and traditionally given as gifts throughout Albania, especially in the region of Berat. Seafood specialties are also common in the coastal cities of [[Durr\u00ebs]], [[Sarand\u00eb]] and [[Vlor\u00eb]]. In high elevation localities, smoked meat and pickled preserves are common.\n\n=== Cinema ===\n{{Main|Cinema of Albania}}\n\n[[File:Eliza Dushku (3756552915).jpg|230px|thumb|right|[[Albanian Americans|Albanian-American]] actress [[Eliza Dushku]] produced the documentary ''[[Dear Albania]]''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/eliza-dushku/albania-travel-_b_946341.html |title=Why You Must Visit Albania |work=Huffington Post|date=September 2, 2011 |accessdate=March 11, 2012 |first=Eliza |last=Dushku}}</ref> with a crew from [[Travel Channel]] and [[Lonely Planet]], promoting tourism in Albania.]]\n\nThe history of [[Cinema of Albania|Cinema in Albania]] dates back to 1911 and 1912 with the first showings of foreign films and few documentaries in the pre-war and inter-war period.<ref>[http://www.aqshf.gov.al/ Albania National Film Archive]</ref> The first public showing to occur in Albania was a little-known title, ''Paddy the Reliable'', a comical story. The publication of foreign films began in the cities of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] and [[Kor\u00e7\u00eb]].\n\nThe first Albanian films were mostly [[documentaries]]; the first was about the [[Monastir Congress]] that sanctioned the [[Albanian alphabet]] in 1908. During communism, the Albanian Film Institute that later became known as [[Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] was founded with Soviet assistance, focusing mostly on propaganda of wartime struggles.\n\nAfter 1945, the [[communist state|communist government]] founded the [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|Kinostudio Shqip\u00ebria e Re]] in 1952. This was followed by the first Albanian [[epic film]], ''[[The Great Warrior Skanderbeg|Sk\u00ebnderbeu]]'', a cooperation with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] artists chronicling the life and fight of the Albanian national hero [[Gjergj Kastriot Skanderbeg|Skanderbeg]]. The film was awarded from the [[Cannes Film Festival]].\n\nNotable [[List of Albanian film directors|Albanian film directors]] include [[Andamion Murataj]], [[Besim Sahat\u00e7iu]], [[Xhanfize Keko]], [[Dhimit\u00ebr Anagnosti]], [[Kujtim \u00c7ashku]], [[Luljeta Hoxha]], [[Saim Kokona]], [[Saimir Kumbaro]], [[Kristaq Mitro]], [[Leon Qafzezi]] and [[Gjergj Xhuvani]]. Famous actors in Albania include [[Nik Xhelilaj]], [[Klement Tinaj]], [[Masiela Lusha]], [[Blerim Destani]], [[Aleksand\u00ebr Moisiu]], [[Tinka Kurti]], [[Pjet\u00ebr Malota]], [[Sand\u00ebr Prosi]] and [[Margarita Xhepa]].\n\nBy 1990, about 200 movies had been produced, and Albania had over 450 theaters. With the economic transition after the collapse of communism in the 1990s, the Kinostudio was broken up and privatised. A new [[Albanian National Center of Cinematography|National Center of Cinematography]] was established, while cities built modern cinema theatres showing mostly American movies.\n\nThe [[Tirana International Film Festival]] was established in 2003 and has become the premier and largest film festival in the country as well as in the Balkans. [[Durr\u00ebs]] hosts the [[International Film Summerfest of Durr\u00ebs]], the second largest international film festival in the country which takes place every year in late August or early September in [[Durr\u00ebs Amphitheatre]].\n\nThere are internationally renowned actors in the Albanian diaspora, such as the [[Albanian Americans|Albanian-Americans]] [[Eliza Dushku]], [[Jim Belushi|Jim]] and [[John Belushi]], [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo-Albanians]] [[Bekim Fehmiu]] and [[Arta Dobroshi]] and [[Albanians in Turkey|Turkish-Albanian]] [[Barish Arduch|Barish Ardu\u00e7]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Sports ===\n{{See also|Albania at the Olympics|Albania at the Mediterranean Games}}\n\n{{multiple image\n |align = right\n |total_width = 240\n |image1 = Olympique de Marseille - Association de la Jeunesse auxerroise 2007 2008 Lorik Cana.jpg\n |width1 = 1010 |height1 =\n |image2 = Loro borici.jpg\n |width2 =  875 |height2 =\n |footer = [[Lorik Cana]] is Albania's most capped player of all time.

The country made their Winter Olympic Games debut in [[Winter Olympics 2006|2006]]. Albania missed the next four games, two of them due to the 1980 and 1984 boycotts, but returned for the 1992 games in [[1992 Olympic Winter Games|Barcelona]]. Since then, Albania have participated in all games. Albania normally competes in events that include swimming, athletics, weightlifting, shooting and wrestling. The country have been represented by the [[National Olympic Committee of Albania]] since 1972. The nation has participated at the [[Mediterranean Games]] since the games of [[1987 Mediterranean Games|1987]] in Syria. The Albanian athletes have won a total of 43 (8 gold, 17 silver and 18 bronze) medals from [[1987 Mediterranean Games|1987]] to [[2013 Mediterranean Games|2013]].\n\nPopular sports in Albania include [[Football in Albania|Football]], Weightlifting, [[Albania national basketball team|Basketball]], Volleyball, Tennis, Swimming, [[rugby union|Rugby]], and Gymnastics. Football is by far the most popular sport in Albania. It is governed by the [[Football Association of Albania]] ({{lang-sq|Federata Shqiptare e Futbollit}}, F.SH.F.), which was created in 1930 and has membership in [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]]. Football arrived in Albania early in the 20th century when the inhabitants of the northern city of [[Shkod\u00ebr]] were surprised to see a strange game being played by students at a Christian mission.\n\nThe [[Albania national football team]], ranking 51th in the [[FIFA World Rankings|World]] in 2017 (highest 22nd in August 22, 2015) have won the [[1946 Balkan Cup]] and the [[Rothmans International Tournament 2000|Malta Rothmans International Tournament 2000]], but had never participated in any major [[UEFA]] or [[FIFA]] tournament, until [[UEFA Euro 2016]], Albania's first ever appearance at the continental tournament and at a major men's football tournament.

Albanian weightlifters have won a total of 16 medals at the [[European Weightlifting Championships|European Championships]] with 1 of them being gold, 7 silver and 8 bronze. In the [[World Weightlifting Championships]], the Albanian weightlifting team has won in [[1972 World Weightlifting Championships|1972]] a gold in [[2002 World Weightlifting Championships|2002]] a silver and in [[2011 World Weightlifting Championships|2011]] a bronze medal.\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Diaspora ===\n{{Main article|Albanian diaspora}}\n\nSince antiquity, Albanians have established communities in many regions throughout southern [[Europe]]. The modern Albanian diaspora was formed largely in the [[15th century]], when many Albanians emigrated to southern [[Arbereshe people|Italy]], especially in [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]] also to [[Albanians in greece|Greece]], to escape either various socio-political difficulties and the Ottoman conquest. Other destinations includes Turkey, United States, Argentina and Chile. After the fall of communism in 1991, many [[Albanians]] have migrated out of Albania to [[Albanian Australians|Australia]], [[Albanian Canadians|Canada]], [[Albania-France relations|France]], [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]], [[Albanians in Italy|Italy]], [[Albanians in Sweden|Scandinavia]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]] and the [[Albanians in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]].\n\nNotable people of [[List of Albanians|Albanian]] origin includes [[Mother Teresa]], [[Ferid Murad]], [[Rita Ora]], [[Bebe Rexha]], [[Dua Lipa]], [[Tony Dovolani]], [[Fadil Berisha]], [[Shkodran Mustafi]], [[Granit Xhaka]], [[Xherdan Shaqiri]], [[Mateo Musacchio]], [[Ernesto Sabato]], [[Cecilia Bolocco]] and many others. <small>(See also: [[List of Albanians]])</small>\n\n== International rankings ==\n{{Main|International rankings of Albania}}\nThe following are international rankings of Albania, including those measuring life quality, health care quality, stability, press freedom, and income.\n:{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:65%;\"|Index\n! style=\"width:15%;\"|Rank\n! style=\"width:20%;\"|Countries reviewed\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of countries by literacy rate|Literacy Rate]] 2011\n|6||183\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[World Bank|Ease of Protecting Minority Investors]]<ref>{{cite web|title=4.2.1 Ease of protecting minority investors|url=https://www.globalinnovationindex.org/gii-2016-report#|website=globalinnovationindex.org|page=342|language=English|format=PDF}}</ref> 2015\n|8||128\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[The Heritage Foundation|Trade Freedom Index]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Trade freedom \u2013 country rankings|url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/herit_trade_freedom/|website=TheGlobalEconomy.com}}</ref> 2016\n|10||179\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association|ILGA-Europe LGBT rights]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Annual Review of the Human Rights Situation of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex People in Europe|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/sites/default/files/Attachments/01_full_annual_review_updated.pdf|website=ilga-europe.org|publisher=ILGA-Europe|accessdate=8 July 2015|format=PDF|date=2015}}</ref> 2015\n|19||50\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[The Heritage Foundation|Fiscal Freedom Index]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Fiscal freedom \u2013 country rankings|url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/herit_fiscal_freedom/|website=TheGlobalEconomy.com}}</ref> 2016\n|35||179\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of countries by life expectancy|Life Expectancy]] 2015\n|37||190\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[The Heritage Foundation|Monetary Freedom Index]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Monetary freedom \u2013 country rankings|url=http://www.theglobaleconomy.com/rankings/herit_monetary_freedom/|website=TheGlobalEconomy.com}}</ref> 2016\n|49||181\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Social Progress Index]] 2017<ref>{{cite web|title=SOCIAL PROGRESS INDEX 2017|url=http://www.socialprogressindex.com/assets/downloads/resources/en/English-2017-Social-Progress-Index-Findings-Report_embargo-d-until-June-21-2017.pdf|website=socialprogressindex.com|page=4|language=English|format=PDF|quote=Full 2017 Social Progress Index Rankings; 52 - Albania}}</ref>\n|52||150\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Global Peace Index]] 2015\n|52||163\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[List of countries by Fragile States Index|Fragile States Index]] 2016\n|54||178\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Inequality adjusted Human Development Index]] 2015\n|55||151\n|-\n|align=\"left\"|[[Ease of doing business index|Ease of doing Business Index]] 2017\n|58||190\n|}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Outline of Albania]]\n* [[Index of Albania-related articles]]\n* [[Bibliography of Albania]]\n* {{books-inline|Albania}}\n{{Portal bar|Albania|Tirana|Mediterranean|Europe|NATO}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notes\n| notes =\n\n{{efn\n| name = status\n| {{Kosovo-note}}\n}}\n\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* ''History of the Party of Labor of Albania''.

However, in his biography of Mu\u1e25ammad (1934), [[Tor Andr\u00e6]] always used the term ''Allah'', though he allows that this \"conception of God\" seems to imply that it is different from that of the Jewish and Christian theologies.<ref name=\"Watt45\">William Montgomery Watt, ''Islam and Christianity today: A Contribution to Dialogue'', [[Routledge]], 1983, p.45</ref>\n\nLanguages which may not commonly use the term ''Allah'' to denote God may still contain popular expressions which use the word.

The power vacuum left by the decline of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] was filled by numerous local dynasties such as the [[Sallarid dynasty|Sallarids]], [[Sajid dynasty|Sajids]], [[Shaddadids]], [[Rawadid dynasty|Rawadids]] and [[Buyid dynasty|Buyids]]. At the beginning of the 11th century, the territory was gradually seized by waves of [[Oghuz Turks]] from [[Central Asia]]. The first of these Turkic dynasties established was the [[Seljuk Empire]], who entered the area now known as Azerbaijan by 1067.\n\nThe pre-Turkic population that lived on the territory of modern Azerbaijan spoke several Indo-European and Caucasian languages, among them [[Armenian language|Armenian]]<ref>\n{{cite web\n|author=Hewsen, Robert H. \n|title=Armenia: a Historical Atlas\n|location=Chicago\n|publisher=University of Chicago Press\n|year=2001\n}} map Caucasian Albania\n</ref><ref>\n{{cite web\n|author=Hewsen, Robert H.\n|title=Ethno-History and the Armenian Influence upon the Caucasian Albanians\n|work=Classical Armenian Culture: Influences and Creativity\n|editor=Thomas J.

Parliamentary elections are held every five years, on the first Sunday of November. The [[New Azerbaijan Party|Yeni Azerbaijan Party]], and independents loyal to the ruling government, currently hold almost all of the Parliament's 125 seats. During the [[Azerbaijani parliamentary election, 2010|2010 Parliamentary election]], the opposition parties, [[Musavat]] and [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party]], failed to win a single seat.

The president is authorized to form the Cabinet, a collective executive body, accountable to both the president and the National Assembly. The Cabinet of Azerbaijan consists primarily of the prime minister, his deputies, and ministers. The president does not have the right to dissolve the National Assembly, but he has the right to veto its decisions. To override the presidential veto, the parliament must have a majority of 95 votes. The judicial power is vested in the [[Constitutional Court of Azerbaijan|Constitutional Court]], [[Supreme Court of Azerbaijan|Supreme Court]], and the [[Economic Court of Azerbaijan|Economic Court]]. The president nominates the judges in these courts. The [[European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice]] (CEPEJ) report refers to the Azerbaijani justice model on the selection of new judges as best practice that reflects the particular features and the course of development towards ensuring the independence and quality of the judiciary in a new democracy.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?p=&Ref=CEPEJ-COOP(2011)1&Language=lanEnglish&Ver=original&BackColorInternet=DBDCF2&BackColorIntranet=FDC864&BackColorLogged=FDC864&direct=true|title=Efficiency of justice \u2013 CEPEJ \u2013 European Commission for the Efficiency of Justice (CEPEJ) \u2013 Report requested by the Ministry of Justice of Azerbaijan \u2013 Assessment of policy and procedures for the selection of judges in Azerbaijan \u2013 prepared by Mr Audun Hognes BERG, Head of International Secretariat, Norwegian Courts Administration, CEPEJ Bureau member and Ms Ivana GORANI\u0106, Director of the Judicial Academy, Republic of Croatia, Representative of the Lisbon Network to the CEPEJ|last=CEPEJ|first=Council of Europe, Human Rights and Rule of Law, Efficiency of justice -|website=wcd.coe.int|access-date=2017-03-14}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jean|first=Jean \u2013 Paul|year=2015|title=High quality justice for all member states of the Council of Europe|url=https://www.coe.int/t/dghl/cooperation/cepej/textes/CEPEJ_Study22_EN.pdf|journal=Council of Europe|volume=|page=119|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe Security Council is the deliberative body under the president, and he organizes it according to the Constitution.

The oldest versions of the Book of Dede Korkut consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among Turkic peoples living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to Lewis (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the Akkoyunlu Confederation of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves \"Turcoman\" rather than \"Oghuz,\" had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen.

This form of art is represented by a wide range of handicrafts, such as chasing, jeweler, engraving in metal, carving in wood, stone and bone, carpet-making, lasing, pattern weaving and printing, knitting and embroidery.

Even though scientific [[research]] is not their main goal, many amateur astronomers make a contribution to astronomy by monitoring [[variable stars]], tracking [[asteroid]]s and discovering transient objects, such as [[comet]]s and [[nova]]e.\n\nThe typical amateur astronomer is one who does not depend on the field of astronomy as a primary source of [[income]] or support, and does not have a [[professional degree]] or advanced academic training in the subject.  Many amateurs are beginners or [[hobby]]ists, while others have a high degree of experience in astronomy and often assist and work alongside professional astronomers.\n\nAmateur astronomy is usually associated with viewing the [[night sky]] when most celestial objects and events are visible, but sometimes amateur astronomers also operate during the day for events such as [[sunspot]]s and [[solar eclipse]]s.  Amateur astronomers often look at the sky using nothing more than their eyes, but common tools for amateur astronomy include portable [[optical telescope|telescopes]] and [[binoculars]].\n\nPeople have studied the sky throughout history in an amateur framework, without any formal method of funding.  It is only within about the past century, however, that professional astronomy has become an activity clearly distinguished from amateur astronomy, and other related activities.\n\n== Objectives ==\n[[File:The Cat's Paw Remastered.jpeg|thumb|An image of the [[Cat's Paw Nebula]] created combining the work of professional and amateur astronomers. The image is the combination of the 2.2-metre MPG/ESO telescope of the La Silla Observatory in Chile and a 0.4-meter amateur telescope.]]\nCollectively, amateur astronomers observe a variety of celestial objects and [[phenomenon|phenomena]].  Common targets of amateur astronomers include the [[Moon]], [[planet]]s, [[star]]s, [[comet]]s, [[meteor shower]]s, and a variety of [[deep sky object]]s such as [[star cluster]]s, [[galaxy|galaxies]], and [[nebula]]e.  Many amateurs like to specialise in observing particular objects, types of objects, or types of events which interest them. One branch of amateur astronomy, amateur [[astrophotography]], involves the taking of photos of the night sky.  Astrophotography has become more popular with the introduction of far easier to use equipment including, digital cameras, DSLR cameras and relatively sophisticated purpose built high quality [[CCD camera]]s.\n\nMost amateur astronomers work at [[visible spectrum|visible wavelengths]], but a small minority experiment with wavelengths outside the visible spectrum.  An early pioneer of [[radio astronomy]] was [[Grote Reber]], an  amateur astronomer who constructed the first purpose built [[radio telescope]] in the late 1930s to follow up on the discovery of [[radio frequency|radio wavelength]] emissions from space by [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]].  Non-visual amateur astronomy includes the use of [[infrared filter]]s on conventional telescopes, and also the use of [[radio telescope]]s.  Some amateur astronomers use home-made radio telescopes, while others use radio telescopes that were originally built for astronomy research but have since been made available for use by amateurs.  The [[One-Mile Telescope]] is one such example.\n\n== Common tools ==\n[[File:Beneath the Milky Way.jpg|thumb|Places like [[Paranal Observatory]] offer crystal clear skies for observing astronomical objects with or without instruments.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |title=Beneath the Milky Way\n |url=http://www.eso.org/public/images/potw1613a/\n |publisher=[[European Southern Observatory]]\n |accessdate=29 March 2016\n}}</ref>]]\n\nAmateur astronomers use a range of instruments to study the [[sky]], depending on a combination of their interests and resources.  Methods include simply looking at the night sky with the [[naked eye]], using [[binoculars]], and using a variety of [[optical telescope]]s of varying power and quality, as well as additional sophisticated equipment, such as [[camera]]s, to study light from the sky in both the visual and non-visual parts of the [[spectrum]].  Commercial telescopes are available, new and used, but it is also common for amateur astronomers to build (or commission the building of) their own custom telescopes.  Some people even focus on [[amateur telescope making]] as their primary interest within the hobby of amateur astronomy.\n\nAlthough specialized and experienced amateur astronomers tend to acquire more specialized and more powerful equipment over time, relatively simple equipment is often preferred for certain tasks.  Binoculars, for instance, although generally of lower power than the majority of telescopes, also tend to provide a wider [[field of view]], which is preferable for looking at some objects in the night sky.\n\nAmateur astronomers also use [[star chart]]s that, depending on experience and intentions, may range from simple [[planisphere]]s through to detailed charts of very specific areas of the night sky.  A range of astronomy software is available and used by amateur astronomers, including software that generates maps of the sky, software to assist with astrophotography, observation scheduling software, and software to perform various calculations pertaining to astronomical phenomena.\n\nAmateur astronomers often like to keep records of their observations, which usually takes the form of an observing log.  Observing logs typically record details about which objects were observed and when, as well as describing the details that were seen.  Sketching is sometimes used within logs, and photographic records of observations have also been used in recent times. The information gathered is used to help studies and interactions between amateur astronomers in yearly gatherings. Although not professional information or credible, it is a way for the hobby lovers to share their new sightings and experiences.\n\nThe Internet is an essential tool of amateur astronomers. The popularity of CCD imaging among amateurs has led to large numbers of web sites being written by individuals about their images and equipment. Much of the social interaction of amateur astronomy occurs on mailing lists or discussion groups. Discussion group servers host numerous astronomy lists. A great deal of the commerce of amateur astronomy, the buying and selling of equipment, occurs online. Many amateurs use online tools to plan their nightly observing sessions using tools such as the [[Clear Sky Chart]].\n\n== Common techniques ==\nWhile a number of interesting celestial objects are readily identified by the naked eye, sometimes with the aid of a star chart, many others are so faint or inconspicuous that technical means are necessary to locate them. Although many methods are used in amateur astronomy, most are variations of a few specific techniques.\n\n=== Star hopping ===\n{{Main|Star hopping}}\n'''Star hopping''' is a method often used by amateur astronomers with low-tech equipment such as binoculars or a manually driven telescope.  It involves the use of maps (or memory) to locate known landmark stars, and \"hopping\" between them, often with the aid of a [[finderscope]].  Because of its simplicity, star hopping is a very common method for finding objects that are close to naked-eye stars.\n\nMore advanced methods of locating objects in the sky include [[telescope mount]]s with ''setting circles'', which assist with pointing telescopes to positions in the sky that are known to contain objects of interest, and ''GOTO telescopes'', which are fully automated telescopes that are capable of locating objects on demand (having first been [[calibration|calibrated]]).\n\n=== Setting circles ===\n{{Main|Setting circles}}\n'''Setting circles''' are [[angular measurement]] scales that can be placed on the two main [[Rotation around a fixed axis|rotation axes]] of some telescopes.  Since the widespread adoption of digital setting circles, any classical engraved setting circle is now specifically identified as an \"analog setting circle\" (ASC).  By knowing the [[coordinate]]s of an object (usually given in [[equatorial coordinates]]), the telescope user can use the setting circle to align the telescope in the appropriate direction before looking through its [[eyepiece]].  A computerized setting circle is called a \"digital setting circle\" (DSC).  Although digital setting circles can be used to display a telescope's [[right ascension|RA]] and [[declination|Dec]] coordinates, they are not simply a digital read-out of what can be seen on the telescope's analog setting circles.  As with go-to telescopes, digital setting circle computers (commercial names include Argo Navis, Sky Commander, and NGC Max) contain databases of tens of thousands of celestial objects and projections of planet positions.\n\nTo find an object, such as globular cluster [[NGC 6712]], one does not need to look up the RA and Dec coordinates in a book, and then move the telescope to those numerical readings.  Rather, the object is chosen from the database and arrow markers appear in the display which indicate the direction to move the telescope.  The telescope is moved until the distance value reaches zero. When both the RA and Dec axes are thus \"zeroed out\", the object should be in the eyepiece. The user therefore does not have to go back and forth from some other database (such as a book or laptop) to match the desired object's listed coordinates to the coordinates on the telescope. However, many DSCs, and also go-to systems, can work in conjunction with laptop sky programs.{{Citation needed|This whole paragraph is not cited from anything.|date=November 2016}}\n\nComputerized systems provide the further advantage of computing coordinate precession. Traditional printed sources are subtitled by the [[Epoch (astronomy)|''epoch'' year]], which refers to the positions of celestial objects at a given time to the nearest year (e.g., J2005, J2007).  Most such printed sources have been updated for intervals of only about every fifty years (e.g., J1900, J1950, J2000).  Computerized sources, on the other hand, are able to calculate the right ascension and declination of the \"epoch of date\" to the exact instant of observation.\n\n===GoTo telescopes===\n{{Main|GoTo (telescopes)}}\n'''GOTO telescopes''' have become more popular since the 1980s as technology has improved and prices have been reduced.  With these computer-driven telescopes, the user typically enters the name of the item of interest and the mechanics of the telescope point the telescope towards that item automatically.  They have several notable advantages for amateur astronomers intent on [[research]].  For example, GOTO telescopes tend to be faster for locating items of interest than star hopping, allowing more time for studying of the object.  GOTO also allows manufacturers to add equatorial tracking to mechanically simpler alt-azimuth telescope mounts, allowing them to produce an overall less expensive product. GOTO telescopes usually have to be calibrated using alignment stars in order to provide accurate tracking and positioning. However, several telescope manufacturers have recently developed telescope systems that are calibrated with the use of built-in GPS, decreasing the time it takes to set up a telescope at the start of an observing session.\n\n===Remote control telescopes===\nWith the development of fast Internet in the last part of the 20th century along with advances in computer controlled telescope mounts and CCD cameras \"Remote Telescope\" astronomy is now a viable means for amateur astronomers not aligned with major telescope facilities to partake in research and deep sky imaging. This enables anyone to control a telescope a large distance away in a dark location. The observers can image through the telescopes using CCD cameras. The digital data collected by the telescope is then transmitted and displayed to the user by means of the Internet. An example of a digital remote telescope operation for public use via the Internet is the [[Bareket observatory]], and there are telescope farms in [[New Mexico]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Remote Observatories |url=http://www.nmskies.com/ |website=www.nmskies.com}}</ref> [[Australia]] and [[Atacama Desert#Astronomical observatories|Atacama]] in Chile.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Maury |first1=Alain |date= |title=SPACE : A cost effective solution for your observatory |url=http://www.spaceobs.com/en/content/download/73/6584/version/3/file/hosting-condition-telescope-chile.pdf}}</ref>\n\n=== Imaging techniques ===\n{{expand section|date=November 2013}}\n{{See also|Astrophotography}}\nAmateur astronomers engage in many imaging techniques including [[film]], [[DSLR]], [[LRGB]], and [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[astrophotography]]. Because CCD imagers are linear, [[image processing]] may be used to subtract away the effects of light pollution, which has increased the popularity of astrophotography in urban areas. Narrowband filters may also be used to minimize light pollution.<ref>{{cite web |title=What are the advantages of CCD imaging over digital camera astrophotography? |url=http://starizona.com/acb/ccd/faq02.aspx |publisher=Starizona |accessdate=15 November 2013}}</ref>\n[[File:Milky_way_-route_292_shiga_kusatsu_road-_1920x1080.webm|thumb|500px|center|Video of the night sky taken with [[DSLR camera]]s in [[Japan]].]]\n\n== Scientific research ==\nScientific [[research]] is most often not the ''main'' goal for many amateur astronomers, unlike professional astronomers.  Work of scientific merit is possible, however, and many amateurs successfully contribute to the knowledge base of professional astronomers.  Astronomy is sometimes promoted as one of the few remaining sciences for which amateurs can still contribute useful data.  To recognize this, the [[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]] annually gives [[Amateur Achievement Award of Astronomical Society of the Pacific|Amateur Achievement Awards]] for significant contributions to astronomy by amateurs.\n\nThe majority of scientific contributions by amateur astronomers are in the area of data collection.  In particular, this applies where large numbers of amateur astronomers with small telescopes are more effective than the relatively small number of large telescopes that are available to professional astronomers.  Several organizations, such as the [[American Association of Variable Star Observers]], exist to help coordinate these contributions.\n\nAmateur astronomers often contribute toward activities such as monitoring the changes in brightness of [[variable star]]s and [[supernova]]e, helping to track [[asteroid]]s, and observing [[occultation]]s to determine both the shape of asteroids and the shape of the terrain on the apparent edge of the [[Moon]] as seen from Earth. With more advanced equipment, but still cheap in comparison to professional setups, amateur astronomers can measure the light spectrum emitted from astronomical objects, which can yield high-quality scientific data if the measurements are performed with due care.  A relatively recent role for amateur astronomers is searching for overlooked phenomena (e.g., [[Kreutz Sungrazers]]) in the vast libraries of digital images and other data captured by Earth and space based observatories, much of which is available over the Internet.\n\nIn the past and present, amateur astronomers have played a major role in discovering new [[comet]]s.  Recently however, funding of projects such as the [[LINEAR|Lincoln Near-Earth Asteroid Research]] and [[Near Earth Asteroid Tracking]] projects has meant that ''most'' comets are now discovered by automated systems, long before it is possible for amateurs to see them.\n\n== Societies ==\n{{main|List of astronomical societies}}\nThere are a large number of amateur [[astronomical society|astronomical societies]] around the world, that serve as a meeting point for those interested in amateur astronomy. Members range from active observers with their own equipment to \"armchair astronomers\" who are simply interested in the topic. Societies range widely in their goals and activities, which may depend on a variety of factors such as geographic spread, local circumstances, size, and membership. For example, a small local society located in dark countryside may focus on practical observing and [[star parties]], whereas a large one based in a major city might have numerous members but be limited by [[light pollution]] and thus hold regular indoor meetings with guest speakers instead. Major national or international societies generally publish their own [[journal]] or [[newsletter]], and some hold large multi-day meetings akin to a [[scientific conference]] or [[convention (meeting)|convention]]. They may also have sections devoted to particular topics, such as [[observing the Moon]] or [[amateur telescope making]].\n\n==Notable amateur astronomers==\n{{Main|Category:Amateur astronomers}}\n* [[George Alcock]], discovered several comets and novae.\n* [[Thomas Bopp]], shared the discovery of [[Comet Hale-Bopp]] in 1995 with unemployed PhD physicist [[Alan Hale (astronomer)|Alan Hale]].\n* [[Robert Burnham, Jr.]] (1931\u20131993), author of the ''Celestial Handbook''.\n* [[Andrew Ainslie Common]] (1841\u20131903), built his own very large reflecting telescopes and demonstrated that photography could record astronomical features invisible to the human eye.\n* [[Robert E.

Today aikido is found all over the world in a number of styles, with broad ranges of interpretation and emphasis. However, they all share techniques formulated by Ueshiba and most have concern for the well-being of the attacker.\n\n==Etymology and basic philosophy==\n[[File:\u5408\u6c23\u9053.svg|thumb|80px|\"Aikid\u014d\" written with \"[[Qi|ki]]\" in its [[Ky\u016bjitai|old character form]] ]]\n\nThe word \"aikido\" is formed of three [[kanji]]:\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u5408|\u5408]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ai''&nbsp;\u2013 joining, unifying, combining, fitting\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''ki''&nbsp;\u2013 spirit, energy, mood, morale\n* {{lang|ja|[[wikt:en:\u9053|\u9053]]}}&nbsp;\u2013 ''d\u014d''&nbsp;\u2013 way, path\n\nThe term ''[[Aiki (martial arts principle)|aiki]]'' does not readily appear in the Japanese language outside the scope of [[bud\u014d]]. This has led to many possible interpretations of the word.\n{{lang|ja|\u5408}} is mainly used in compounds to mean 'combine, unite, join together, meet', examples being {{lang|ja|\u5408\u540c}} (combined/united), {{lang|ja|\u5408\u6210}} (composition), {{lang|ja|\u7d50\u5408}} (unite/combine/join together), {{lang|ja|\u9023\u5408}} (union/alliance/association), {{lang|ja|\u7d71\u5408}} (combine/unify), and {{lang|ja|\u5408\u610f}} (mutual agreement). There is an idea of [[Norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], {{lang|ja|\u77e5\u308a\u5408\u3046}} (to get to know one another), {{lang|ja|\u8a71\u3057\u5408\u3044}} (talk/discussion/negotiation), and {{lang|ja|\u5f85\u3061\u5408\u308f\u305b\u308b}} (meet by appointment).\n\n{{lang|ja|\u6c17}} is often used to describe a feeling, as in {{lang|ja|X\u6c17\u304c\u3059\u308b}} ('I feel X', as in terms of thinking but with less cognitive reasoning), and {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u6301\u3061}} (feeling/sensation); it is used to mean energy or force, as in {{lang|ja|\u96fb\u6c17}} (electricity) and {{lang|ja|\u78c1\u6c17}} (magnetism); it can also refer to qualities or aspects of people or things, as in {{lang|ja|\u6c17\u8cea}} (spirit/trait/temperament).\n\nThe term {{transl|ja|d\u014d}} is also found in martial arts such as [[judo]] and [[kendo]], and in various non-martial arts, such as [[Japanese calligraphy]] ({{transl|ja|shod\u014d}}), [[ikebana|flower arranging]] ({{transl|ja|kad\u014d}}) and [[Japanese tea ceremony|tea ceremony]] ({{transl|ja|chad\u014d or sad\u014d}}).\n\nTherefore, from a purely literal interpretation, aikido is the \"Way of combining forces\", in that the term ''aiki'' refers to the martial arts principle or tactic of blending with an attacker's movements for the purpose of controlling their actions with minimal effort.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n| last = Pranin\n| first = Stanley\n| title = Aiki\n| encyclopedia = Encyclopedia of Aikido\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n| accessdate=21 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225755/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=10\n| archivedate= 26 September 2007 <!--DASHBot-->\n| deadurl= no}}</ref> One applies {{transl|ja|aiki}} by understanding the rhythm and intent of the attacker to find the optimal position and timing to apply a counter-technique.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Morihei Ueshiba 1939.jpg|thumb|100px|alt=A middle-aged, mustachioed man in a kimono|Ueshiba in Tokyo in 1939]]\nAikido was created by Morihei Ueshiba ({{lang|ja|\u690d\u829d \u76db\u5e73}} {{transl|ja|''[[Ueshiba Morihei]]''}}, 14 December 1883&nbsp;\u2013 26 April 1969), referred to by some aikido practitioners as {{transl|ja|''\u014csensei''}} (''Great Teacher'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=O-Sensei \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2007 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826175452/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia?entryID=533 \n |archivedate=26 August 2014 \n |df= \n}}</ref> The term ''aikido'' was coined in the twentieth century.<ref>Draeger, Donn F.

At that time Ueshiba was referring to his martial art as '''\"Aiki Bud\u014d\"'''. It is unclear exactly when Ueshiba began using the name \"aikido\", but it became the official name of the art in 1942 when the Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society ({{transl|ja|''[[Dai Nippon Butoku Kai]]''}}) was engaged in a government sponsored reorganization and centralization of Japanese martial arts.<ref name=\"Aikido\"/>\n\n===Religious influences===\n[[File:Onisaburo Deguchi 2.jpg|thumb|right|Onisaburo Deguchi]]\nAfter Ueshiba left Hokkaid\u014d in 1919, he met and was profoundly influenced by [[Onisaburo Deguchi]], the spiritual leader of the [[Oomoto|\u014cmoto-ky\u014d]] religion (a neo-[[Shinto]] movement) in [[Ayabe]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Morihei Ueshiba and Onisaburo Deguchi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |date= \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017200533/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=73 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> One of the primary features of \u014cmoto-ky\u014d is its emphasis on the attainment of [[utopia]] during one's life. This was a great influence on Ueshiba's martial arts philosophy of extending love and compassion especially to those who seek to harm others. Aikido demonstrates this philosophy in its emphasis on mastering martial arts so that one may receive an attack and harmlessly redirect it. In an ideal resolution, not only is the receiver unharmed, but so is the attacker.<ref>{{cite web\n| last = Oomoto Foundation\n| title = The Teachings\n| work = Teachings and Scriptures\n| publisher = Netinformational Commission\n| year = 2007\n| url = http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| accessdate = 14 August 2007\n| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070813025607/http://www.oomoto.or.jp/English/enDokt/dokt-en.html\n| archivedate= 13 August 2007 <!--DASHBot-->\n| deadurl= no}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the effect on his spiritual growth, the connection with Deguchi gave Ueshiba entry to elite political and military circles as a martial artist.

However, aikido has many styles, mostly formed by Morihei Ueshiba's major students.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nThe earliest independent styles to emerge were [[Yoseikan Aikido]], begun by [[Minoru Mochizuki]] in 1931,<ref name=\"Mochizuki\"/> [[Yoshinkan]] Aikido, founded by [[Gozo Shioda]] in 1955,<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Yoshinkan Aikido \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225749/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=785 \n |archivedate=26 September 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref> and [[Shodokan Aikido]], founded by [[Kenji Tomiki]] in 1967.<ref name=\"ACE\">{{cite book\n| last = Shishido\n| first = Fumiaki\n| authorlink = Fumiaki Shishida\n|last2=Nariyama\n|first2=Tetsuro\n|authorlink2= Tetsuro Nariyama\n| title = Aikido: Tradition and the Competitive Edge\n| publisher = Shodokan Publishing USA\n| year = 2002\n| isbn = 978-0-9647083-2-7\n}}</ref> The emergence of these styles pre-dated Ueshiba's death and did not cause any major upheavals when they were formalized. Shodokan Aikido, however, was controversial, since it introduced a unique rule-based competition that some felt was contrary to the spirit of aikido.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\nAfter Ueshiba's death in 1969, two more major styles emerged. Significant controversy arose with the departure of the [[Aikikai Hombu Dojo]]'s chief instructor [[Koichi Tohei]], in 1974. Tohei left as a result of a disagreement with the son of the founder, [[Kisshomaru Ueshiba]], who at that time headed the Aikikai Foundation. The disagreement was over the proper role of ''ki'' development in regular aikido training. After Tohei left, he formed his own style, called [[Shin Shin Toitsu Aikido]], and the organization that governs it, the [[Ki Society]] (''Ki no Kenky\u016bkai'').<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Tohei, Koichi \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070807104204/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=701 \n |archivedate=7 August 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nA final major style evolved from Ueshiba's retirement in [[Iwama, Ibaraki]] and the teaching methodology of long term student [[Morihiro Saito]]. It is unofficially referred to as the \"[[Iwama style]]\", and at one point a number of its followers formed a loose network of schools they called [[Iwama Ryu]]. Although Iwama style practitioners remained part of the Aikikai until Saito's death in 2002, followers of Saito subsequently split into two groups.  One remained with the Aikikai and the other formed the independent [[Shinshin Aikishuren Kai]] in 2004 around Saito's son [[Hitohiro Saito]].\n\nToday, the major styles of aikido are each run by a separate governing organization, have their own {{Nihongo|headquarters|\u672c\u90e8\u9053\u5834|honbu d\u014dj\u014d}} in Japan, and have an international breadth.<ref name=\"Styles\"/>\n\n==Ki==\n[[File:ki obsolete.svg|right|float|thumb|100px|This was the [[kanji]] for ''ki'' until 1946, when [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|it was changed]] to {{lang|ja|[[wikt:\u6c17|\u6c17]]}}.]]\n\nThe study of ''[[Qi|ki]]'' is an important component of aikido, and its study defies categorization as either \"physical\" or \"mental\" training, as it encompasses both. The ''[[kanji]]'' for ''ki'' normally is written as {{lang|ja|\u6c17}}. It was written as {{lang|ja|\u6c23}} until the [[T\u014dy\u014d kanji|writing reforms after World War II]], and this older form still is seen on occasion.\n\nThe character for ''ki'' is used in everyday Japanese terms, such as {{Nihongo|\"health\"|\u5143\u6c17|genki}}, or {{Nihongo|\"shyness\"|\u5185\u6c17|uchiki}}. ''Ki'' has many meanings, including \"ambience\", \"mind\", \"mood\", and \"intention\", however, in traditional martial arts it is often used to refer to \"life energy\". [[G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]]'s [[Yoshinkan|Yoshinkan Aikido]], considered one of the \"hard styles\", largely follows Ueshiba's teachings from before World War II, and surmises that the secret to ''ki'' lies in timing and the application of the whole body's strength to a single point.<ref name=\"Shugyo\"/> In later years, Ueshiba's application of ''ki'' in aikido took on a softer, more gentle feel. This was his [[Takemusu]] Aiki and many of his later students teach about ''ki'' from this perspective. [[Koichi Tohei]]'s [[Ki Society]] centers almost exclusively around the study of the [[empirical]] (albeit subjective) experience of ''ki'' with students ranked separately in aikido techniques and ''ki'' development.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed |first=William |title=A Test Worth More than a Thousand Words |year=1997 |url=http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |accessdate=11 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070619083726/http://www.b-smart.net/archive/test_article_0497.html |archivedate=19 June 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\n==Training==\nIn aikido, as in virtually all Japanese [[martial arts]], there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and [[Physical exercise|conditioning]], as well as specific techniques.<ref name=\"AFL\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma\n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990\n| page = 20\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n}}</ref> Because a substantial portion of any aikido curriculum consists of [[throw (grappling)|throws]], beginners learn how to safely fall or roll.<ref name=\"AFL\"/> The specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and [[Pinning hold|pins]]. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.\n\n===Fitness===\n[[File:A\u00efkido-shihoo nage.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Uke (martial arts)|Ukemi]] ({{lang|ja|\u53d7\u3051\u8eab}}) is very important for safe practice]]\nPhysical training goals pursued in conjunction with aikido include controlled [[relaxation technique|relaxation]], correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, [[flexibility (anatomy)|flexibility]], and [[endurance]], with less emphasis on [[strength training]]. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. This distinction can be applied to general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nIn aikido, specific muscles or muscle groups are not isolated and worked to improve tone, mass, or power. Aikido-related training emphasizes the use of coordinated whole-body movement and balance similar to [[yoga]] or [[pilates]]. For example, many dojos begin each class with {{Nihongo|warm-up exercises|\u6e96\u5099\u4f53\u64cd|''junbi tais\u014d''}}, which may include [[stretching]] and [[Uke (martial arts)|ukemi]] (break falls).<ref>{{cite encyclopedia\n |last=Pranin \n |first=Stanley \n |title=Jumbi Taiso \n |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Aikido \n |year=2006 \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071016190245/http://www.aikidojournal.com/encyclopedia.php?entryID=340 \n |archivedate=16 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\n===Roles of ''uke'' and ''tori''===\nAikido training is based primarily on two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (''[[kata]]'') rather than freestyle practice. The basic pattern is for the receiver of the technique (''[[uke (martial arts)|uke]]'') to initiate an attack against the person who applies the technique\u2014the {{lang|ja|\u53d6\u308a}} ''[[Tori (martial arts)|tori]]'', or ''shite'' {{lang|ja|\u4ed5\u624b}} (depending on aikido style), also referred to as {{lang|ja|\u6295\u3052}} ''nage'' (when applying a throwing technique), who neutralises this attack with an aikido technique.<ref name=\"afl2\"/>\n\nBoth halves of the technique, that of ''uke'' and that of ''tori'', are considered essential to aikido training.<ref name=\"afl2\"/> Both are studying aikido principles of blending and adaptation. ''Tori'' learns to blend with and control attacking energy, while ''uke'' learns to become calm and flexible in the disadvantageous, off-balance positions in which ''tori'' places them. This \"receiving\" of the technique is called ''ukemi''.<ref name=\"afl2\">{{cite book\n| last = Homma \n| first = Gaku\n| title = Aikido for Life\n| publisher = North Atlantic Books\n| year = 1990 | pages = 20\u201330\n| location = Berkeley, California\n| isbn = 978-1-55643-078-7\n| url = https://books.google.com/books/about/Aikido_for_Life.html?id=cmvuAkvibXkC\n}}</ref> ''Uke'' continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (e.g., an exposed side), while ''tori'' uses position and timing to keep ''uke'' off-balance and vulnerable. In more advanced training, ''uke'' will sometimes apply {{Nihongo|reversal techniques|\u8fd4\u3057\u6280|kaeshi-waza}} to regain balance and pin or throw ''tori''.\n\n{{Nihongo|''Ukemi''|\u53d7\u8eab}} refers to the act of receiving a technique. Good ''ukemi'' involves attention to the technique, the partner and the immediate environment\u2014it is an active rather than a passive receiving of aikido. The fall itself is part of aikido, and is a way for the practitioner to receive, safely, what would otherwise be a devastating strike or throw.\n\n===Initial attacks===\nAikido techniques are usually a defense against an attack, so students must learn to deliver various types of attacks to be able to practice aikido with a partner. Although attacks are not studied as thoroughly as in striking-based arts, sincere attacks (a strong strike or an immobilizing grab) are needed to study correct and effective application of technique.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\nMany of the {{Nihongo|strikes|\u6253\u3061|uchi}} of aikido resemble cuts from a [[sword]] or other grasped object, which indicate its origins in techniques intended for [[weapon|armed]] combat.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Other techniques, which explicitly appear to be punches (''[[tsuki]]''), are practiced as thrusts with a [[knife]] or sword. [[Kick]]s are generally reserved for upper-level variations; reasons cited include that falls from kicks are especially dangerous, and that kicks (high kicks in particular) were uncommon during the types of combat prevalent in feudal Japan. Some basic strikes include:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Front-of-the-head strike'''|\u6b63\u9762\u6253\u3061|sh\u014dmen'uchi}} a vertical [[knifehand strike]] to the head. In training, this is usually directed at the forehead or the [[Crown (anatomy)|crown]] for safety, but more dangerous versions of this attack target the bridge of the nose and the [[maxillary sinus]].\n* {{Nihongo|'''Side-of-the-head strike'''|\u6a2a\u9762\u6253\u3061|yokomen'uchi}} a diagonal knifehand strike to the side of the head or neck.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest thrust'''|\u80f8\u7a81\u304d|mune-tsuki}} a [[Punch (strike)|punch]] to the [[torso]]. Specific targets include the [[chest]], [[abdomen]], and [[solar plexus]]. Same as {{Nihongo|\"middle-level thrust\"|\u4e2d\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|ch\u016bdan-tsuki}}, and {{Nihongo|\"direct thrust\"|\u76f4\u7a81\u304d|[[choku-tsuki]]}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Face thrust'''|\u9854\u9762\u7a81\u304d|ganmen-tsuki}} a punch to the [[face]]. Same as {{Nihongo|\"upper-level thrust\"|\u4e0a\u6bb5\u7a81\u304d|j\u014ddan-tsuki}}.\n\nBeginners in particular often practice techniques from grabs, both because they are safer and because it is easier to feel the energy and lines of force of a hold than a strike. Some grabs are historically derived from being held while trying to draw a [[Katana|weapon]]; a technique could then be used to free oneself and immobilize or strike the attacker who is grabbing the defender.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> The following are examples of some basic grabs:\n* {{Nihongo|'''Single-hand grab'''|\u7247\u624b\u53d6\u308a|katate-dori}} one hand grabs one wrist.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Both-hands grab'''|\u8af8\u624b\u53d6\u308a|morote-dori}} both hands grab one wrist.

It is sometimes combined with an overhead strike as {{Nihongo|'''Shoulder grab face strike'''|\u80a9\u53d6\u308a\u9762\u6253\u3061|kata-dori men-uchi}}.\n* {{Nihongo|'''Chest grab'''|\u80f8\u53d6\u308a|mune-dori or muna-dori}} grabbing the (clothing of the) chest.

See text for more details.]]\n\nAikido is more of a defensive martial art. It makes use of body movement (''[[tai sabaki]]'') to blend with ''uke''. For example, an \"entering\" (''[[irimi]]'') technique consists of movements inward towards ''uke'', while a {{Nihongo|\"turning\"|\u8ee2\u63db|tenkan}} technique uses a pivoting motion.<ref>{{cite journal\n |last=Amdur \n |first=Ellis \n |title=Irimi \n |journal=Aikido Journal \n |url=http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |deadurl=yes \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017193616/http://www.aikidojournal.com/article.php?articleID=686 \n |archivedate=17 October 2007 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\nAdditionally, an {{Nihongo|\"inside\"|\u5185|uchi}} technique takes place in front of ''uke'', whereas an {{Nihongo|\"outside\"|\u5916|soto}} technique takes place to their side; a {{Nihongo|\"front\"|\u8868|omote}} technique is applied with motion to the front of ''uke'', and a {{Nihongo|\"rear\"|\u88cf|ura}} version is applied with motion towards the rear of ''uke'', usually by incorporating a turning or pivoting motion. Finally, most techniques can be performed while in a seated posture (''[[seiza]]''). Techniques where both ''uke'' and ''tori'' are standing are called ''tachi-waza'', techniques where both start off in ''seiza'' are called ''suwari-waza'', and techniques performed with ''uke'' standing and ''tori'' sitting are called ''hanmi handachi'' ({{lang|ja|\u534a\u8eab\u534a\u7acb}}).<ref name=\"dynamic\"/>\n\nThus, from fewer than twenty basic techniques, there are thousands of possible implementations. For instance, ''ikky\u014d'' can be applied to an opponent moving forward with a strike (perhaps with an ''ura'' type of movement to redirect the incoming force), or to an opponent who has already struck and is now moving back to reestablish distance (perhaps an ''omote-waza'' version). Specific aikido ''kata'' are typically referred to with the formula \"attack-technique(-modifier)\". For instance, ''katate-dori ikky\u014d'' refers to any ''ikky\u014d'' technique executed when ''uke'' is holding one wrist. This could be further specified as ''katate-dori ikky\u014d omote'', referring to any forward-moving ''ikky\u014d'' technique from that grab.\n\n''[[Atemi]]'' ({{lang|ja|\u5f53\u3066\u8eab}}) are strikes (or [[feint]]s) employed during an aikido technique. Some view ''atemi'' as attacks against \"[[pressure point|vital points]]\" meant to cause damage in and of themselves. For instance, [[Gozo Shioda|G\u014dz\u014d Shioda]] described using ''atemi'' in a brawl to quickly down a gang's leader.<ref name=\"Shugyo\">{{cite book\n| first = G\u014dz\u014d\n| last = Shioda\n| authorlink = Gozo Shioda\n|others= Translated by Payet, Jacques\n|author2= Johnston, Christopher\n| title = Aikido Shugyo: Harmony in Confrontation\n| publisher = Shindokan Books\n| year = 2000\n| isbn = 978-0-9687791-2-5\n}}</ref> Others consider ''atemi'', especially to the face, to be methods of distraction meant to enable other techniques.

Consequently, the practice of the weapons arts gives insight into the origin of techniques and movements, and reinforces the concepts of distance, timing, foot movement, presence and connectedness with one's training partner(s).<ref name=\"SOS\">{{cite book\n| last = Ratti\n| first = Oscar\n|last2= Westbrook\n|first2=Adele\n| title = Secrets of the Samurai: The Martial Arts of Feudal Japan\n| publisher = Castle Books\n| year = 1973\n| pages = 23, 356\u2013359\n| location = Edison, New Jersey\n| isbn = 978-0-7858-1073-5}}</ref>\n\n===Multiple attackers and ''randori''===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Embukai01.jpg|left|thumb|Technique performed against two attackers.]]  --><!-- this image is above related paragraph to improve page rendering -->\nOne feature of aikido is training to defend against multiple attackers, often called ''taninzudori'', or ''taninzugake''.

Some aikido organizations use belts to distinguish practitioners' grades, often simply white and [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belts]] to distinguish ''kyu'' and ''dan'' grades, though some use various belt colors. Testing requirements vary, so a particular rank in one organization is not comparable or interchangeable with the rank of another.<ref name=\"ADS\"/> Some dojos do not allow students to take the test to obtain a ''dan'' rank unless they are 16 or older.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:left;\"\n|-\n! rank !! belt !! color !! type\n|-\n| ''ky\u016b'' || [[File:Judo white belt.svg|65px]] || white || ''mudansha'' / ''y\u016bky\u016bsha''\n|-\n| ''dan'' || [[File:Judo black belt.svg|65px]] || black || ''y\u016bdansha''\n|}\n\nThe uniform worn for practicing aikido (''[[aikidogi|aikid\u014dgi]]'') is similar to the training uniform (''[[keikogi]]'') used in most other modern martial arts; simple trousers and a wraparound jacket, usually white.

In many schools, its use is reserved for practitioners with (''dan'') ranks or for instructors, while others allow all practitioners to wear a ''hakama'' regardless of rank.<ref name=\"ADS\"/>\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe most common criticism of aikido is that it suffers from a lack of realism in training.

As a result, strikes to vital points by ''tori'', entering (''irimi'') and initiation of techniques by ''tori'', the distinction between ''omote'' (front side) and ''ura'' (back side) techniques, and the use of weapons, were all de-emphasized or eliminated from practice.

However, there are many other colloquial uses of the word, all with some relation to its [[etymology]].\n[[File:Teke bottle.JPG|thumb|upright|20th-century Rwandan bottle. Artistic works may serve practical functions, in addition to their decorative value.]]\n\nFew modern scholars have been more divided than Plato and Aristotle on the question concerning the importance of art, with Aristotle strongly supporting art in general and Plato generally being opposed to its relative importance. \n\nSeveral dialogues in Plato tackle questions about art: Socrates says that poetry is inspired by the [[muses]], and is not rational. He speaks approvingly of this, and other forms of divine madness (drunkenness, eroticism, and dreaming) in the ''[[Phaedrus (Plato)|Phaedrus]] ''(265a\u2013c), and yet in the ''[[Republic (Plato)|''Republic'']]'' wants to outlaw Homer's great poetic art, and laughter as well. In ''[[Ion (dialogue)|Ion]]'', Socrates gives no hint of the disapproval of Homer that he expresses in the ''Republic''. The dialogue ''Ion'' suggests that [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' functioned in the ancient Greek world as the Bible does today in the modern Christian world: as divinely inspired literary art that can provide moral guidance, if only it can be properly interpreted. \n\nWith regards to the literary art and the musical arts, Aristotle considered [[epic poetry]], tragedy, comedy, [[Dithyramb|dithyrambic poetry]] and music to be [[Mimesis|mimetic]] or imitative art, each varying in imitation by medium, object, and manner.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' I 1447a</ref> For example, music imitates with the media of rhythm and harmony, whereas dance imitates with rhythm alone, and poetry with language. The forms also differ in their object of imitation. Comedy, for instance, is a dramatic imitation of men worse than average; whereas tragedy imitates men slightly better than average. Lastly, the forms differ in their manner of imitation\u2014through narrative or character, through change or no change, and through drama or no drama.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' III</ref> Aristotle believed that imitation is natural to mankind and constitutes one of mankind's advantages over animals.<ref>Aristotle, ''Poetics'' IV</ref>\n\nThe second, and more recent, sense of the word ''art'' as an abbreviation for ''creative art'' or ''fine art'' emerged in the early 17th century.<ref>''[[Shorter Oxford English Dictionary|The New Shorter Oxford English Dictionary]]''. [[Oxford University Press]], Oxford 1993, p.&nbsp;120</ref> Fine art refers to a skill used to express the artist's creativity, or to engage the audience's aesthetic sensibilities, or to draw the audience towards consideration of more refined or ''finer'' work of art.\n\nWithin this latter sense, the word ''art'' may refer to several things: (i) a study of a creative skill, (ii) a process of using the creative skill, (iii) a product of the creative skill, or (iv) the audience's experience with the creative skill. The creative arts (''art'' as discipline) are a collection of disciplines which produce ''artworks'' (''art'' as objects) that are compelled by a personal drive (art as activity) and convey a message, mood, or symbolism for the perceiver to interpret (art as experience).  Art is something that stimulates an individual's thoughts, emotions, beliefs, or ideas through the senses. Works of art can be explicitly made for this purpose or interpreted on the basis of images or objects. For some scholars, such as [[Kant]], the sciences and the arts could be distinguished by taking science as representing the domain of knowledge and the arts as representing the domain of the freedom of artistic expression.\n\nOften, if the skill is being used in a common or practical way, people will consider it a craft instead of art. Likewise, if the skill is being used in a commercial or industrial way, it may be considered [[commercial art]] instead of fine art. On the other hand, crafts and design are sometimes considered [[applied art]]. Some art followers have argued that the difference between fine art and applied art has more to do with value judgments made about the art than any clear definitional difference.<ref>David Novitz, ''The Boundaries of Art'', 1992</ref> However, even fine art often has goals beyond pure creativity and self-expression. The purpose of works of art may be to communicate ideas, such as in politically, spiritually, or philosophically motivated art; to create a sense of beauty (see [[aesthetics]]); to explore the nature of perception; for pleasure; or to generate strong [[emotion]]s. The purpose may also be seemingly nonexistent.\n\nThe nature of art has been described by philosopher [[Richard Wollheim]] as \"one of the most elusive of the traditional problems of human culture\".<ref>Richard Wollheim, ''Art and its objects'', p. 1, 2nd ed., 1980, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0-521-29706-0}}</ref> Art has been defined as a vehicle for the expression or communication of emotions and ideas, a means for exploring and appreciating [[Formalism (art)|formal elements]] for their own sake, and as ''[[mimesis]]'' or [[Representation (arts)|representation]]. Art as mimesis has deep roots in the philosophy of [[Aristotle]].<ref name=Levinson5/> [[Leo Tolstoy]] identified art as a use of indirect means to communicate from one person to another.<ref name=Levinson5>Jerrold Levinson, ''The Oxford Handbook of Aesthetics'', Oxford University Press, 2003, p5. {{ISBN|0-19-927945-4}}</ref> [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[R.G.

Collingwood's view, expressed in ''The Principles of Art'', is considered in Wollheim, op. cit. 1980 pp 36\u201343</ref> The theory of art as form has its roots in the philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]], and was developed in the early twentieth century by [[Roger Fry]] and [[Clive Bell]].  More recently, thinkers influenced by [[Martin Heidegger]] have interpreted art as the means by which a community develops for itself a medium for self-expression and interpretation.<ref>[[Martin Heidegger]], \"The Origin of the Work of Art\", in ''Poetry, Language, Thought'', (Harper Perennial, 2001).

Each of these centers of early civilization developed a unique and characteristic style in its art. Because of the size and duration of these civilizations, more of their art works have survived and more of their influence has been transmitted to other cultures and later times. Some also have provided the first records of how artists worked. For example, this period of Greek art saw a veneration of the human physical form and the development of equivalent skills to show musculature, poise, beauty, and anatomically correct proportions.\n\nIn [[Byzantine art|Byzantine]] and [[Medieval art]] of the Western Middle Ages, much art focused on the expression of subjects about Biblical and religious culture, and used styles that showed the higher glory of a heavenly world, such as the use of gold in the background of paintings, or glass in mosaics or windows, which also presented figures in idealized, patterned (flat) forms. Nevertheless, a classical realist tradition persisted in small Byzantine works, and realism steadily grew in the art of Catholic Europe.\n\n[[Renaissance art]] had a greatly increased emphasis on the realistic depiction of the material world, and the place of humans in it, reflected in the corporeality of the human body, and development of a systematic method of [[graphical perspective]] to depict recession in a three-dimensional picture space.\n[[File:Tugra Mahmuds II.gif|right|thumb|The stylized signature of [[Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]] was written in [[Islamic calligraphy]]. It reads ''Mahmud Khan son of Abdulhamid is forever victorious''.]]\n[[File:Great Mosque of Kairouan Panorama - Grande Mosqu\u00e9e de Kairouan Panorama.jpg|thumb|The [[Mosque of Uqba|Great Mosque of Kairouan]] in Tunisia, also called the Mosque of Uqba, is one of the finest, most significant and best preserved artistic and architectural examples of early great mosques.

Further east, religion dominated artistic styles and forms too. India and Tibet saw emphasis on painted sculptures and dance, while religious painting borrowed many conventions from sculpture and tended to bright contrasting colors with emphasis on outlines. China saw the flourishing of many art forms: jade carving, bronzework, pottery (including the stunning [[terracotta army]] of Emperor Qin), poetry, calligraphy, music, painting, drama, fiction, etc. Chinese styles vary greatly from era to era and each one is traditionally named after the ruling dynasty. So, for example, [[Tang dynasty]] paintings are monochromatic and sparse, emphasizing idealized landscapes, but [[Ming Dynasty]] paintings are busy and colorful, and focus on telling stories via setting and composition. Japan names its styles after imperial dynasties too, and also saw much interplay between the styles of calligraphy and painting. [[Woodblock printing]] became important in Japan after the 17th century.\n\n[[File:Ma Lin Guests.jpg|thumb|left|Painting by [[Song dynasty]] artist Ma Lin, ''circa'' 1250. 24.8&nbsp;\u00d7 25.2&nbsp;cm]]\n\nThe western [[Age of Enlightenment]] in the 18th century saw artistic depictions of physical and rational certainties of the clockwork universe, as well as politically revolutionary visions of a post-monarchist world, such as [[William Blake|Blake]]'s portrayal of Newton as a divine geometer, or [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s propagandistic paintings. This led to [[Romanticism|Romantic]] rejections of this in favor of pictures of the emotional side and individuality of humans, exemplified in the novels of [[Goethe]]. The late 19th century then saw a host of artistic movements, such as [[academic art]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[impressionism]] and [[fauvism]] among others.\n\nThe history of twentieth-century art is a narrative of endless possibilities and the search for new standards, each being torn down in succession by the next. Thus the parameters of [[impressionism]], [[Expressionism]], [[Fauvism]], [[Cubism]], [[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], etc. cannot be maintained very much beyond the time of their invention. Increasing [[globalization|global]] interaction during this time saw an equivalent influence of other cultures into Western art. Thus, Japanese woodblock prints (themselves influenced by Western Renaissance draftsmanship) had an immense influence on impressionism and subsequent development. Later, [[African art|African sculptures]] were taken up by Picasso and to some extent by [[Matisse]]. Similarly, in the 19th and 20th centuries the West has had huge impacts on Eastern art with originally western ideas like [[Communism]] and [[Post-Modernism]] exerting a powerful influence.\n\n[[Modernism]], the idealistic search for truth, gave way in the latter half of the 20th century to a realization of its unattainability. [[Theodor W. Adorno]] said in 1970, \"It is now taken for granted that nothing which concerns art can be taken for granted any more: neither art itself, nor art in relationship to the whole, nor even the right of art to exist.\"<ref>Adorno, Theodor W., ''Aesthetic Theory'', (1970 in German)</ref> [[Relativism]] was accepted as an unavoidable truth, which led to the period of [[contemporary art]] and [[List of postmodern critics|postmodern criticism]], where cultures of the world and of history are seen as changing forms, which can be appreciated and drawn from only with [[skepticism]] and irony. Furthermore, the separation of cultures is increasingly blurred and some argue it is now more appropriate to think in terms of a global culture, rather than of regional ones.\n\n==Forms, genres, media, and styles==\n[[File:Ingres, Napoleon on his Imperial throne.jpg|thumb|''[[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]]'' by [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]] (French, 1806), oil on canvas]]\n{{Main|The arts}}\nThe creative arts are often divided into more specific categories, typically along perceptually distinguishable categories such as [[List of art mediums|media]], [[genre]], [[Art movement|styles]], and form.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Walton|first1=Kendall L.|title=Categories of Art|journal=The Philosophical Review|date=1 January 1970|volume=79|issue=3|pages=334\u2013367|doi=10.2307/2183933|jstor=2183933}}</ref> '''''Art form''''' refers to the [[elements of art]] that are independent of its interpretation or significance.

Philosophers almost universally reject this view and hold that the properties and aesthetics of art extend beyond materials, techniques, and form.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Xu|first1=Min|last2=Deng|first2=Guifang|title=Against Zangwill\u2019s Extreme Formalism About Inorganic Nature|journal=Philosophia|date=2 December 2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=249\u2013257|doi=10.1007/s11406-014-9575-1|url=http://xy.cmsproxy.sysu.edu.cn/pub/hkmacc/docs/2014-12/20141215194213014875.pdf|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> Unfortunately, there is little consensus on terminology for these informal properties. Some authors refer to subject matter and content \u2013 i.e., [[denotation]]s and [[connotation]]s \u2013 while others prefer terms like [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]] and [[Importance|significance]].<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\nExtreme Intentionalism holds that [[authorial intent]] plays a decisive role in the meaning of a work of art, conveying the content or essential main idea, while all other interpretations can be discarded.<ref name=\"Livingston\">{{cite journal|last1=Livingston|first1=Paisley|title=Intentionalism in Aesthetics.|journal=New Literary History|date=1998|volume=29|issue=4|pages=831\u2013846|doi=10.1353/nlh.1998.0042}}</ref> It defines the subject as the persons or idea represented,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Munk|first1=Eduard|last2=Beck|first2=Charles|last3=Felton|first3=Cornelius Conway|title=The Metres of the Greeks and Romans|date=1844|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SxRgAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA1|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> and the content as the artist's experience of that subject.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tolstoy|first1=Leo|title=What is Art?|date=1899|publisher=Crowell|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SYVAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA24|accessdate=26 February 2017}}</ref> For example, the composition of [[Napoleon I on his Imperial Throne]] is partly borrowed from the [[Statue of Zeus at Olympia]]. As evidenced by the title, the subject is [[Napoleon]], and the content is [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s representation of Napoleon as \"Emperor-God beyond time and space\".<ref name=\"Belton\"/> Similarly to extreme formalism, philosophers typically reject extreme intentionalism, because art may have multiple ambiguous meanings and authorial intent may be unknowable and thus irrelevant. Its restrictive interpretation is \"socially unhealthy, philosophically unreal, and politically unwise\".<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\nFinally, the developing theory of [[post-structuralism]] studies art's significance in a cultural context, such as the ideas, emotions, and reactions prompted by a work.<ref>{{cite conference |first1=Melahat K\u00fc\u00e7\u00fckarslan |last1=Emiro\u011flu | first2=Fitnat Cim\u015fit|last2=Ko\u015f |title=Design Semiotics and Post-Structuralism |conference=12th World Congress of Semiotics |date=16-20 September 2014 |location=New Bulgarian University |url=http://semio2014.org/en/design-semiotics-and-post-structuralism |access-date=26 February 2017}}</ref> The cultural context often reduces to the artist's techniques and intentions, in which case analysis proceeds along lines similar to formalism and intentionalism. However, in other cases historical and material conditions may predominate, such as religious and philosophical convictions, sociopolitical and economic structures, or even climate and geography. [[Art criticism]] continues to grow and develop alongside art.<ref name=\"Belton\"/>\n\n===Skill and craft===\n[[File:Michelangelo, Creation of Adam 03.jpg|thumb|left|[[Adam]].

Art can also simply refer to the developed and efficient use of a [[language]] to convey meaning with immediacy and or depth. Art can be defined as an act of expressing feelings, thoughts, and observations.<ref>Breskin, Vladimir, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110901145415/http://vip.iva.dk/signs/Articles_Signs_International_Section/2010/Breskin_(2010)_Signs_Triad_eng_final_rev_2010.pdf \"Triad: Method for studying the core of the semiotic parity of language and art\"], ''Signs \u2013 International Journal of Semiotics'' 3, pp.1\u201328, 2010. {{ISSN|1902-8822}}</ref>\n\nThere is an understanding that is reached with the material as a result of handling it, which facilitates one's thought processes.\nA common view is that the [[Wikt:epithet|epithet]] \"art\", particular in its elevated sense, requires a certain level of creative expertise by the artist, whether this be a demonstration of technical ability, an originality in stylistic approach, or a combination of these two. Traditionally skill of execution was viewed as a quality inseparable from art and thus necessary for its success; for [[Leonardo da Vinci]], art, neither more nor less than his other endeavors, was a manifestation of skill. [[Rembrandt]]'s work, now praised for its ephemeral virtues, was most admired by his contemporaries for its virtuosity. At the turn of the 20th century, the adroit performances of [[John Singer Sargent]] were alternately admired and viewed with skepticism for their manual fluency, yet at nearly the same time the artist who would become the era's most recognized and peripatetic iconoclast, [[Pablo Picasso]], was completing a traditional academic training at which he excelled.\n\nA common contemporary criticism of some [[modern art]] occurs along the lines of objecting to the apparent lack of skill or ability required in the production of the artistic object. In conceptual art, [[Marcel Duchamp]]'s \"[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]\" is among the first examples of pieces wherein the artist used found objects (\"ready-made\") and exercised no traditionally recognised set of skills. [[Tracey Emin]]'s ''My Bed'', or [[Damien Hirst]]'s ''The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living'' follow this example and also manipulate the mass media. Emin slept (and engaged in other activities) in her bed before placing the result in a gallery as work of art. Hirst came up with the conceptual design for the artwork but has left most of the eventual creation of many works to employed artisans. Hirst's celebrity is founded entirely on his ability to produce shocking concepts. The actual production in many conceptual and contemporary works of art is a matter of assembly of found objects. However, there are many modernist and contemporary artists who continue to excel in the skills of drawing and painting and in creating ''hands-on'' works of art.\n\n==Purpose ==\n[[File:Transition 1880.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Navajo rug]] made ''circa'' 1880]]\n[[File:B Escorial 93v.jpg|thumb|[[Mozarabic art|Mozarabic]] [[Commentary on the Apocalypse|Beatus]] [[miniature (illuminated manuscript)|miniature]]. Spain, late 10th century]]\nArt has had a great number of different functions throughout its history, making its purpose difficult to abstract or quantify to any single concept. This does not imply that the purpose of Art is \"vague\", but that it has had many unique, different reasons for being created. Some of these functions of Art are provided in the following outline. The different purposes of art may be grouped according to those that are non-motivated, and those that are motivated (L\u00e9vi-Strauss).\n\n===Non-motivated functions ===\nThe non-motivated purposes of art are those that are integral to being human, transcend the individual, or do not fulfill a specific external purpose. In this sense, Art, as creativity, is something humans must do by their very nature (i.e.,&nbsp;no other species creates art), and is therefore beyond utility.\n# ''[[fine arts|Basic human instinct for harmony, balance, rhythm]].'' Art at this level is not an action or an object, but an internal appreciation of balance and harmony (beauty), and therefore an aspect of being human beyond utility.<blockquote>\"Imitation, then, is one instinct of our nature. Next, there is the instinct for 'harmony' and rhythm, meters being manifestly sections of rhythm. Persons, therefore, starting with this natural gift developed by degrees their special aptitudes, till their rude improvisations gave birth to Poetry.\" -Aristotle<ref>{{cite book |author=Aristotle |title=Republic |chapter=[Book 10:] The Poetics |others=Note: Although speaking mostly of poetry here, the Ancient Greeks often speak of the arts collectively |url=http://www.authorama.com/the-poetics-2.html |website=www.authorama.com}}</ref></blockquote>\n# ''Experience of the mysterious.'' Art provides a way to experience one's self in relation to the universe. This experience may often come unmotivated, as one appreciates art, music or poetry.<blockquote>\"The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.\" -Albert Einstein<ref>Einstein, Albert. \"The World as I See It\". http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/essay.htm</ref></blockquote>\n# ''Expression of the imagination.'' Art provides a means to express the imagination in non-grammatic ways that are not tied to the formality of spoken or written language. Unlike words, which come in sequences and each of which have a definite meaning, art provides a range of forms, symbols and ideas with meanings that are malleable.<blockquote>\"Jupiter's eagle [as an example of art] is not, like logical (aesthetic) attributes of an object, the concept of the sublimity and majesty of creation, but rather something else\u2014something that gives the imagination an incentive to spread its flight over a whole host of kindred representations that provoke more thought than admits of expression in a concept determined by words. They furnish an aesthetic idea, which serves the above rational idea as a substitute for logical presentation, but with the proper function, however, of animating the mind by opening out for it a prospect into a field of kindred representations stretching beyond its ken.\" -Immanuel Kant<ref>Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Aesthetic Judgement'' (1790).</ref></blockquote>\n# ''Ritualistic and symbolic functions.'' In many cultures, art is used in rituals, performances and dances as a decoration or symbol. While these often have no specific utilitarian (motivated) purpose, anthropologists know that they often serve a purpose at the level of meaning within a particular culture. This meaning is not furnished by any one individual, but is often the result of many generations of change, and of a cosmological relationship within the culture.<blockquote>\"Most scholars who deal with rock paintings or objects recovered from prehistoric contexts that cannot be explained in utilitarian terms and are thus categorized as decorative, ritual or symbolic, are aware of the trap posed by the term 'art'.\" -Silva Tomaskova<ref>Silvia Tomaskova, ''Places of Art: Art and Archaeology in Context'': (1997)</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n===Motivated functions ===\nMotivated purposes of art refer to intentional, conscious actions on the part of the artists or creator. These may be to bring about political change, to comment on an aspect of society, to convey a specific emotion or mood, to address personal psychology, to illustrate another discipline, to (with commercial arts) sell a product, or simply as a form of communication.\n# ''Communication.'' Art, at its simplest, is a form of communication. As most forms of communication have an intent or goal directed toward another individual, this is a motivated purpose. Illustrative arts, such as scientific illustration, are a form of art as communication. Maps are another example. However, the content need not be scientific. Emotions, moods and feelings are also communicated through art.<blockquote>\"[Art is a set of] artefacts or images with symbolic meanings as a means of communication.\" -Steve Mithen<ref>Steve Mithen. ''The Prehistory of the Mind: The Cognitive Origins of Art, Religion and Science''. 1999</ref></blockquote>\n# ''Art as entertainment''. Art may seek to bring about a particular emotion or mood, for the purpose of relaxing or entertaining the viewer. This is often the function of the art industries of Motion Pictures and Video Games.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}\n# ''The Avante-Garde. Art for political change.'' One of the defining functions of early twentieth-century art has been to use visual images to bring about political change. Art movements that had this goal\u2014[[Dadaism]], [[Surrealism]], [[Russian constructivism]], and [[Abstract Expressionism]], among others\u2014are collectively referred to as the ''avante-garde'' arts.<blockquote>\"By contrast, the realistic attitude, inspired by positivism, from Saint Thomas Aquinas to Anatole France, clearly seems to me to be hostile to any intellectual or moral advancement. I loathe it, for it is made up of mediocrity, hate, and dull conceit. It is this attitude which today gives birth to these ridiculous books, these insulting plays. It constantly feeds on and derives strength from the newspapers and stultifies both science and art by assiduously flattering the lowest of tastes; clarity bordering on stupidity, a dog's life.\" -Andr\u00e9 Breton (Surrealism)<ref>Andr\u00e9 Breton, ''Surrealist Manifesto'' (1924)</ref></blockquote>\n# ''Art as a \"free zone\"'', removed from the action of the social censure. Unlike the [[avant-garde]] movements, which wanted to erase cultural differences in order to produce new universal values, [[contemporary art]] has enhanced its tolerance towards cultural differences as well as its critical and liberating functions (social inquiry, activism, subversion, deconstruction ...), becoming a more open place for research and experimentation.<ref>According to [[Maurizio Bolognini]] this is not only associated with the [[postmodern art|postmodern]] rejection of all canons but with a process of secularization of art, which is finally considered as \"a mere (albeit essential) convention, sustained and reproduced by the art system (artists, galleries, critics, collectors), providing a free zone, that is, a more open place for experimentation, removed from the constraints of the practical sphere.\": see {{Cite book\n|title=Postdigitale\n|url= http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm\n|year=2008\n|author=Maurizio Bolognini\n|publisher=Carocci\n|location=Rome\n|isbn=978-88-430-4739-0\n\n}}, [http://www.bolognini.org/bolognini_PDIG.htm#ch3b chap. 3].</ref>\n# ''Art for social inquiry, subversion and/or anarchy.'' While similar to art for political change, subversive or deconstructivist art may seek to question aspects of society without any specific political goal.

Art is also used by art therapists, psychotherapists and clinical psychologists as [[art therapy]]. The [[Art therapy#The Diagnostic Drawing Series (DDS)|Diagnostic Drawing Series]], for example, is used to determine the personality and emotional functioning of a patient. The end product is not the principal goal in this case, but rather a process of healing, through creative acts, is sought. The resultant piece of artwork may also offer insight into the troubles experienced by the subject and may suggest suitable approaches to be used in more conventional forms of psychiatric therapy.\n# ''Art for propaganda, or commercialism.'' Art is often utilized as a form of propaganda, and thus can be used to subtly influence popular conceptions or mood. In a similar way, art that tries to sell a product also influences mood and emotion. In both cases, the purpose of art here is to subtly manipulate the viewer into a particular emotional or psychological response toward a particular idea or object.<ref>[[Roland Barthes]], ''Mythologies''</ref>\n# ''Art as a fitness indicator.'' It has been argued that the ability of the human brain by far exceeds what was needed for survival in the ancestral environment. One [[evolutionary psychology]] explanation for this is that the human brain and associated traits (such as artistic ability and creativity) are the human equivalent of the [[peacock]]'s tail. The purpose of the male peacock's extravagant tail has been argued to be to attract females (see also [[Fisherian runaway]] and [[handicap principle]]). According to this theory superior execution of art was evolutionary important because it attracted mates.<ref name=\"Dutton\">[[Denis Dutton|Dutton, Denis]]. 2003. \"Aesthetics and Evolutionary Psychology\" in ''The Oxford Handbook for Aesthetics''. Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nThe functions of art described above are not mutually exclusive, as many of them may overlap. For example, art for the purpose of entertainment may also seek to sell a product, i.e. the movie or video game.\n\n==Public access==\n[[File:Chateau-de-versailles-cour.jpg|upright=2|thumb|left|Versailles: [[Louis Le Vau]] opened up the interior court to create the expansive entrance ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', later copied all over Europe.]]\n\nSince ancient times, much of the finest art has represented a deliberate display of wealth or power, often achieved by using massive scale and expensive materials. Much art has been commissioned by political rulers or religious establishments, with more modest versions only available to the most wealthy in society.  \n\nNevertheless, there have been many periods where art of very high quality was available, in terms of ownership, across large parts of society, above all in cheap media such as pottery, which persists in the ground, and perishable media such as textiles and wood. In many different cultures, the [[ceramics of indigenous peoples of the Americas]] are found in such a wide range of graves that they were clearly not restricted to a [[social elite]], though other forms of art may have been. Reproductive methods such as [[Molding (process)|moulds]] made mass-production easier, and were used to bring high-quality [[Ancient Roman pottery]] and Greek [[Tanagra figurine]]s to a very wide market. [[Cylinder seal]]s were both artistic and practical, and very widely used by what can be loosely called the middle class in the [[Ancient Near East]]. Once [[coin]]s were widely used these also became an art form that reached the widest range of society.  \n\nAnother important innovation came in the 15th century in Europe, when [[printmaking]] began with small [[woodcut]]s, mostly religious, that were often very small and hand-colored, and affordable even by [[peasant]]s who glued them to the walls of their homes. Printed books were initially very expensive, but fell steadily in price until by the 19th century even the poorest could afford some with printed illustrations. [[Popular prints]] of many different sorts have decorated homes and other places for centuries.\n\n[[Public art|Public buildings and monuments]], secular and religious, by their nature normally address the whole of society, and visitors as viewers, and display to the general public has long been an important factor in their design. [[Egyptian temple]]s are typical in that the most largest and most lavish decoration was placed on the parts that could be seen by the general public, rather than the areas seen only by the priests. Many areas of royal palaces, castles and the houses of the social elite were often generally accessible, and large parts of the art collections of such people could often be seen, either by anybody, or by those able to pay a small price, or those wearing the correct clothes, regardless of who they were, as at the [[Palace of Versailles]], where the appropriate extra accessories (silver shoe buckles and a sword) could be hired from shops outside.\n\nSpecial arrangements were made to allow the public to see many royal or private collections placed in galleries, as with the [[Orleans Collection#Collection in Paris|Orleans Collection]] mostly housed in a wing of the [[Palais Royal]] in Paris, which could be visited for most of the 18th century. In Italy the art tourism of the [[Grand Tour]] became a major industry from the Renaissance onwards, and governments and cities made efforts to make their key works accessible. The British [[Royal Collection]] remains distinct, but large donations such as the [[Old Royal Library]] were made from it to the [[British Museum]], established in 1753. The [[Uffizi]] in [[Florence]] opened entirely as a gallery in 1765, though this function had been gradually taking the building over from the original civil servants' offices for a long time before. The building now occupied by the [[Prado]] in Madrid was built before the French Revolution for the public display of parts of the royal art collection, and similar royal galleries open to the public existed in [[Vienna]], Munich and other capitals. The opening of the [[Mus\u00e9e du Louvre]] during the [[French Revolution]] (in 1793) as a public museum for much of the former French royal collection certainly marked an important stage in the development of public access to art, transferring ownership to a republican state, but was a continuation of trends already well established.\n\nMost modern public museums and art education programs for children in schools can be traced back to this impulse to have art available to everyone. Museums in the United States tend to be gifts from the very rich to the masses. ([[The Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York City, for example, was created by [[John Taylor Johnston]], a railroad executive whose personal art collection seeded the museum.) But despite all this, at least one of the important functions of art in the 21st century remains as a marker of wealth and social status.\n\n[[File:BeuysAchberg78.jpg|thumb|Performance by [[Joseph Beuys]], 1978: ''Everyone an artist \u2013 On the way to the libertarian form of the social organism'']]\n\nThere have been attempts by artists to create art that can not be bought by the wealthy as a status object. One of the prime original motivators of much of the art of the late 1960s and 1970s was to create art that could not be bought and sold. It is \"necessary to present something more than mere objects\"<ref>{{cite journal|title=An Interview with Joseph Beuys|journal=ArtForum|date=December 1969|first=Willoughby|last=Sharp|volume=8|issue=4|page=45|id= |url=}}</ref> said the major post war German artist Joseph Beuys. This time period saw the rise of such things as [[performance art]], [[video art]], and [[conceptual art]]. The idea was that if the artwork was a performance that would leave nothing behind, or was simply an idea, it could not be bought and sold. \"Democratic precepts revolving around the idea that a work of art is a commodity impelled the aesthetic innovation which germinated in the mid-1960s and was reaped throughout the 1970s. Artists broadly identified under the heading of Conceptual art ... substituting performance and publishing activities for engagement with both the material and materialistic concerns of painted or sculptural form ... [have] endeavored to undermine the art object qua object.\"<ref>Rorimer, Anne: ''New Art in the 60s and 70s Redefining Reality'', page 35. Thames and Hudson, 2001.</ref>\n\nIn the decades since, these ideas have been somewhat lost as the art market has learned to sell limited edition DVDs of video works,<ref>{{cite news | first=Mia | last=Fineman | title=YouTube for Artists The best places to find video art online. | date=21 March 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.slate.com/id/2162382/ | work =Slate | pages = | accessdate = 3 August 2007 | language = }}</ref> invitations to exclusive performance art pieces, and the objects left over from conceptual pieces. Many of these performances create works that are only understood by the elite who have been educated as to why an idea or video or piece of apparent garbage may be considered art. The marker of status becomes understanding the work instead of necessarily owning it, and the artwork remains an upper-class activity. \"With the widespread use of DVD recording technology in the early 2000s, artists, and the gallery system that derives its profits from the sale of artworks, gained an important means of controlling the sale of video and computer artworks in limited editions to collectors.\"<ref>Robertson, Jean and Craig McDaniel: ''Themes of Contemporary Art, Visual Art after 1980'', page 16. Oxford University Press, 2005.</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n[[File:JEAN LOUIS TH\u00c9ODORE G\u00c9RICAULT - La Balsa de la Medusa (Museo del Louvre, 1818-19).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.5|[[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'', ''circa'' 1820]]\n\nArt has long been controversial, that is to say disliked by some viewers, for a wide variety of reasons, though most pre-modern controversies are dimly recorded, or completely lost to a modern view. [[Iconoclasm]] is the destruction of art that is disliked for a variety of reasons, including religious ones. [[Aniconism]] is a general dislike of either all figurative images, or often just religious ones, and has been a thread in many major religions. It has been a crucial factor in the history of [[Islamic art]], where [[depictions of Muhammad]] remain especially controversial. Much art has been disliked purely because it depicted or otherwise stood for unpopular rulers, parties or other groups. Artistic conventions have often been conservative and taken very seriously by [[art critic]]s, though often much less so by a wider public. The [[iconography|iconographic]] content of art could cause controversy, as with late medieval depictions of the new motif of the [[Swoon of the Virgin]] in scenes of the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]]. [[The Last Judgment (Michelangelo)|The ''Last Judgment'']] by [[Michelangelo]] was controversial for various reasons, including breaches of [[decorum]] through nudity and the [[Apollo]]-like pose of Christ.\n\nThe content of much formal art through history was dictated by the patron or commissioner rather than just the artist, but with the advent of [[Romanticism]], and economic changes in the production of art, the artists' vision became the usual determinant of the content of his art, increasing the incidence of controversies, though often reducing their significance. Strong incentives for perceived originality and publicity also encouraged artists to court controversy. [[Th\u00e9odore G\u00e9ricault]]'s ''[[The Raft of the Medusa|Raft of the Medusa]]'' (c. 1820), was in part a political commentary on a recent event. [[\u00c9douard Manet]]'s ''[[The Luncheon on the Grass|Le D\u00e9jeuner sur l'Herbe]]'' (1863), was considered scandalous not because of the [[nude]] woman, but because she is seated next to men fully dressed in the clothing of the time, rather than in robes of the antique world. [[John Singer Sargent]]'s ''[[Portrait of Madame X|Madame Pierre Gautreau (Madam&nbsp;X)]]'' (1884), caused a controversy over the reddish pink used to color the woman's ear lobe, considered far too suggestive and supposedly ruining the high-society model's reputation.\n\nThe gradual abandonment of naturalism and the depiction of realistic representations of the visual appearance of subjects in the 19th and 20th centuries led to a rolling controversy lasting for over a century. In the twentieth century, [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' (1937) used arresting [[cubism|cubist]] techniques and stark [[Monochrome painting|monochromatic oils]], to depict the harrowing consequences of a contemporary bombing of a small, ancient Basque town. [[Leon Golub]]'s ''Interrogation III'' (1981), depicts a female nude, hooded detainee strapped to a chair, her legs open to reveal her sexual organs, surrounded by two tormentors dressed in everyday clothing. [[Andres Serrano]]'s ''[[Piss Christ]]'' (1989) is a photograph of a crucifix, sacred to the Christian religion and representing [[Jesus Christ|Christ]]'s sacrifice and final suffering, submerged in a glass of the artist's own urine. The resulting uproar led to comments in the United States Senate about public funding of the arts.\n\n==Theory==\n{{Main|Aesthetics}}\nBefore Modernism, aesthetics in Western art was greatly concerned with achieving the appropriate balance between different aspects of [[Realism (arts)|realism or truth to nature]] and the [[Idealism|ideal]]; ideas as to what the appropriate balance is have shifted to and fro over the centuries.  This concern is largely absent in other traditions of art.  The aesthetic theorist [[John Ruskin]], who championed what he saw as the naturalism of [[J. M. W. Turner|J.&nbsp;M.&nbsp;W. Turner]], saw art's role as the communication by artifice of an essential truth that could only be found in nature.<ref>\"go to nature in all [[singleness of heart]], rejecting nothing and selecting nothing, and scorning nothing, believing all things are right and good, and rejoicing always in the truth\". [[John Ruskin|Ruskin, John]]. ''[[Modern Painters]]'', Volume I, 1843. London: Smith, Elder and Co.</ref>\n\nThe definition and evaluation of art has become especially problematic since the 20th century. [[Richard Wollheim]] distinguishes three approaches to assessing the aesthetic value of art: the [[Aesthetic realism|Realist]], whereby aesthetic quality is an absolute value independent of any human view; the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|Objectivist]], whereby it is also an absolute value, but is dependent on general human experience; and the [[Relativist]] [[Aesthetic relativism|position]], whereby it is not an absolute value, but depends on, and varies with, the human experience of different humans.<ref>Wollheim 1980, ''Essay VI''. pp. 231\u201339.</ref>\n\n===Arrival of Modernism===\n[[File:Piet Mondriaan, 1930 - Mondrian Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow.jpg|thumb|''Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow'' (1930) by [[Piet Mondrian]] (Dutch, 1872\u20131944)]]\nThe arrival of [[Modernism]] in the late nineteenth century lead to a radical break in the conception of the function of art,<ref>Griselda Pollock, ''Differencing the Canon''. Routledge, London & New York, 1999. {{ISBN|0-415-06700-6}}</ref> and then again in the late twentieth century with the advent of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]]. [[Clement Greenberg]]'s 1960 article \"Modernist Painting\" defines modern art as \"the use of characteristic methods of a discipline to criticize the discipline itself\".<ref name = \"Frascina\">''Modern Art and Modernism: A Critical Anthology''. ed. Francis Frascina and Charles Harrison, 1982.</ref> Greenberg originally applied this idea to the Abstract Expressionist movement and used it as a way to understand and justify flat (non-illusionistic) abstract painting:\n{{quote|Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium, using art to conceal art; modernism used art to call attention to art. The limitations that constitute the medium of painting\u2014the flat surface, the shape of the support, the properties of the pigment\u2014were treated by the Old Masters as negative factors that could be acknowledged only implicitly or indirectly. Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly.<ref name = \"Frascina\" />}} After Greenberg, several important art theorists emerged, such as [[Michael Fried]], [[T. J. Clark (historian)|T.&nbsp;J.&nbsp;Clark]], [[Rosalind Krauss]], [[Linda Nochlin]] and [[Griselda Pollock]] among others. Though only originally intended as a way of understanding a specific set of artists, Greenberg's definition of modern art is important to many of the ideas of art within the various art movements of the 20th century and early 21st century.\n\n[[Pop art]]ists like [[Andy Warhol]] became both noteworthy and influential through work including and possibly critiquing popular culture, as well as the [[art world]]. Artists of the 1980s, 1990s, and 2000s expanded this technique of self-criticism beyond ''high art'' to all cultural image-making, including fashion images, comics, billboards and pornography.\n\nDuchamp once proposed that art is any activity of any kind- everything. However, the way that only certain activities are classified today as art is a social construction.<ref name=\"Duchamp Interview Clip\">{{YouTube|haon2DXWvLk|Duchamp Two Statements}}{{Dead link|date=May 2016}}</ref> There is evidence that there may be an element of truth to this. ''[[The Invention of Art: A Cultural History]]'' is an art history book which examines the construction of the modern system of the arts i.e. [[Fine Art]]. Shiner finds evidence that the older system of the arts before our modern system (fine art) held art to be any skilled human activity i.e. Ancient Greek society did not possess the term art but [[techne]]. Techne can be understood neither as art or craft, the reason being that the distinctions of art and [[craft]] are historical products that came later on in human history. Techne included painting, sculpting and music but also; cooking, medicine, [[horsemanship]], [[geometry]], [[carpentry]], [[prophecy]], and farming etc.\n\n===New Criticism and the \"intentional fallacy\"===\nFollowing Duchamp during the first half of the twentieth century, a significant shift to general aesthetic theory took place which attempted to apply aesthetic theory between various forms of art, including the literary arts and the visual arts, to each other. This resulted in the rise of the [[New Criticism]] school and debate concerning ''the intentional fallacy''. At issue was the question of whether the aesthetic intentions of the artist in creating the work of art, whatever its specific form, should be associated with the criticism and evaluation of the final product of the work of art, or, if the work of art should be evaluated on its own merits independent of the intentions of the artist.\n\nIn 1946, [[W. K. Wimsatt|William K. Wimsatt]] and [[Monroe Beardsley]] published a classic and controversial New Critical essay entitled \"[[Intentional Fallacy|The Intentional Fallacy]]\", in which they argued strongly against the relevance of an [[Authorial intentionality|author's intention]], or \"intended meaning\" in the analysis of a literary work. For Wimsatt and Beardsley, the words on the page were all that mattered; importation of meanings from outside the text was considered irrelevant, and potentially distracting.\n\nIn another essay, \"[[Affective fallacy|The Affective Fallacy]],\" which served as a kind of sister essay to \"The Intentional Fallacy\" Wimsatt and Beardsley also discounted the reader's personal/emotional reaction to a literary work as a valid means of analyzing a text. This fallacy would later be repudiated by theorists from the [[reader-response]] school of literary theory. Ironically, one of the leading theorists from this school, [[Stanley Fish]], was himself trained by New Critics. Fish criticizes Wimsatt and Beardsley in his essay \"Literature in the Reader\" (1970).<ref>Leitch, Vincent B. , et al., eds. ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism''. New York: W. W. Norton & Company, 2001.</ref>\n\nAs summarized by Gaut and Livingston in their essay \"The Creation of Art\": \"Structuralist and post-structuralists theorists and critics were sharply critical of many aspects of New Criticism, beginning with the emphasis on aesthetic appreciation and the so-called autonomy of art, but they reiterated the attack on biographical criticisms's assumption that the artist's activities and experience were a privileged critical topic.\"<ref>Gaut and Livingston, ''The Creation of Art'', p. 3.</ref> These authors contend that: \"Anti-intentionalists, such as formalists, hold that the intentions involved in the making of art are irrelevant or peripheral to correctly interpreting art. So details of the act of creating a work, though possibly of interest in themselves, have no bearing on the correct interpretation of the work.\"<ref name=\"Gaut and Livingston, p.6\">Gaut and Livingston, p. 6.</ref>\n\nGaut and Livingston define the intentionalists as distinct from formalists stating that: \"Intentionalists, unlike formalists, hold that reference to intentions is essential in fixing the correct interpretation of works.\" They quote [[Richard Wollheim]] as stating that, \"The task of criticism is the reconstruction of the creative process, where the creative process must in turn be thought of as something not stopping short of, but terminating on, the work of art itself.\"<ref name=\"Gaut and Livingston, p.6\"/>\n\n===\"Linguistic turn\" and its debate===\nThe end of the 20th century fostered an extensive debate known as the linguistic turn controversy, or the \"innocent eye debate\", and generally referred to as the structuralism-[[poststructuralism]] debate in the philosophy of art. This debate discussed the encounter of the work of art as being determined by the relative extent to which the conceptual encounter with the work of art dominates over the perceptual encounter with the work of art.<ref>''Philosophy for Architecture'', Branco Mitrovic, 2012.</ref> \n\nDecisive for the linguistic turn debate in art history and the humanities were the works of yet another tradition, namely the [[structuralism]] of [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] and the ensuing movement of [[poststructuralism]]. In 1981, the artist [[Mark Tansey]] created a work of art titled \"The Innocent Eye\" as a criticism of the prevailing climate of disagreement in the philosophy of art during the closing decades of the 20th century. Influential theorists include [[Judith Butler]], [[Luce Irigaray]], [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Michel Foucault]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. The power of language, more specifically of certain rhetorical tropes, in art history and historical discourse was explored by [[Hayden White]]. The fact that language is ''not'' a transparent medium of thought had been stressed by a very different form of [[philosophy of language]] which originated in the works of [[Johann Georg Hamann]] and [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]].<ref>''Introduction to Structuralism'', Michael Lane, Basic Books University of Michigan, 1970.</ref> [[Ernst Gombrich]] and [[Nelson Goodman]] in his book ''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]'' came to hold that the conceptual encounter with the work of art predominated exclusively over the perceptual and visual encounter with the work of art during the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>''[[Languages of Art|Languages of Art: An Approach to a Theory of Symbols]]''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merrill, 1968. 2nd ed. Indianapolis: Hackett, 1976. Based on his 1960\u201361 [[John Locke lectures]].</ref> He was challenged on the basis of research done by the Nobel prize winning psychologist [[Roger Sperry]] who maintained that the human visual encounter was not limited to concepts represented in language alone (the linguistic turn) and that other forms of psychological representations of the work of art were equally defensible and demonstrable. Sperry's view eventually prevailed by the end of the 20th century with aesthetic philosophers such as Nick Zangwill strongly defending a return to moderate aesthetic formalism among other alternatives.<ref>Nick Zangwill, \"Feasible Aesthetic Formalism\", ''Nous'', December 1999, pp. 610\u2013629.</ref>\n\n==Classification disputes==\n{{Main|Classificatory disputes about art}}\n[[File:Duchamp Fountaine.jpg|thumb|The original ''[[Fountain (Duchamp)|Fountain]]'' by [[Marcel Duchamp]], 1917, photographed by [[Alfred Stieglitz]] at the [[Little Galleries of the Photo-Secession|291]] after the 1917 [[Society of Independent Artists]] exhibit.

Rather, \"the passionate concerns and interests that humans vest in their social life\" are \"so much a part of all classificatory disputes about art\" (Novitz, 1996). According to Novitz, classificatory disputes are more often disputes about societal values and where society is trying to go than they are about theory proper. For example, when the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' criticized [[Damien Hirst|Hirst]]'s and [[Tracey Emin|Emin]]'s work by arguing \"For 1,000 years art has been one of our great civilising forces. Today, pickled sheep and soiled beds threaten to make barbarians of us all\" they are not advancing a definition or theory about art, but questioning the value of Hirst's and Emin's work.<ref>Painter, Colin.

National Gallery, [[Canberra]], Australia]]\n\nSomewhat in relation to the above, the word ''art'' is also used to apply judgments of value, as in such expressions as \"that meal was a work of art\" (the cook is an artist), or \"the art of deception\", (the highly attained level of skill of the deceiver is praised). It is this use of the word as a measure of high quality and high value that gives the term its flavor of subjectivity. Making judgments of value requires a basis for criticism. At the simplest level, a way to determine whether the impact of the object on the senses meets the criteria to be considered ''art'' is whether it is perceived to be attractive or repulsive. Though perception is always colored by experience, and is necessarily subjective, it is commonly understood that what is not somehow aesthetically satisfying cannot be art. However, \"good\" art is not always or even regularly aesthetically appealing to a majority of viewers. In other words, an artist's prime motivation need not be the pursuit of the aesthetic. Also, art often depicts terrible images made for social, moral, or thought-provoking reasons. For example, [[Francisco Goya]]'s painting depicting the Spanish shootings of 3rd&nbsp;of May 1808 is a graphic depiction of a firing squad executing several pleading civilians. Yet at the same time, the horrific imagery demonstrates Goya's keen artistic ability in composition and execution and produces fitting social and political outrage. Thus, the debate continues as to what mode of aesthetic satisfaction, if any, is required to define 'art'.\n\nThe assumption of new values or the rebellion against accepted notions of what is aesthetically superior need not occur concurrently with a complete abandonment of the pursuit of what is aesthetically appealing. Indeed, the reverse is often true, that the revision of what is popularly conceived of as being aesthetically appealing allows for a re-invigoration of aesthetic sensibility, and a new appreciation for the standards of art itself. Countless schools have proposed their own ways to define quality, yet they all seem to agree in at least one point: once their aesthetic choices are accepted, the value of the work of art is determined by its capacity to transcend the limits of its chosen medium to strike some universal chord by the rarity of the skill of the artist or in its accurate reflection in what is termed the ''[[zeitgeist]]''. Art is often intended to appeal to and connect with human emotion. It can arouse [[aesthetic]] or [[morality|moral]] feelings, and can be understood as a way of communicating these feelings. Artists express something so that their audience is aroused to some extent, but they do not have to do so consciously. Art may be considered an exploration of the [[human condition]]; that is, what it is to be human.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Graham | first1 = Gordon | title = Philosophy of the arts: an introduction to aesthetics | publisher = Taylor & Francis | year = 2005}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Arts|Visual arts}}\n<!-- Please keep entries in alphabetical order & add a short description [[WP:SEEALSO]] -->\n{{div col||20em|small=yes}}\n* [[Art movement]]\n* [[Artist in residence]]\n* [[Formal analysis]]\n* [[List of artistic media]]\n* [[Mathematics and art]]\n* [[Street art]] (or \"independent public art\")\n* [[Outline of the visual arts]], a guide to the subject of art presented as a [[tree structure]]d list of its subtopics.\n{{div col end}}\n<!-- please keep entries in alphabetical order -->\n{{Wikipedia books|Art|position=left}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Shiner, Larry.

They are present in the [[Lower Cambrian]] fossil record along with [[trilobites]] from the [[Redlichiida]], [[Corynexochida]], and [[Ptychopariida]] orders. The last agnostids went [[extinct]] in the Late [[Ordovician]].\n\n==Systematics==\nThe Agnostida are divided into two suborders&nbsp;\u2014 [[Agnostina]] and [[Eodiscina]]&nbsp;\u2014 that are then subdivided into a number of [[family (biology)|families]]. As a group, agnostids are isopygous, meaning that their [[pygidium]] is similar in size and shape to their [[cephalon (arthropod anatomy)|cephalon]]. Most agnostid species were eyeless.\n\nThe systematic position of the order Agnostida within the class Trilobita remains uncertain, and there has been continuing debate whether they are trilobites or a [[stem group]]. The challenge to the status has focused on the Agnostina partly because [[juvenile (organism)|juveniles]] of one genus have been found with legs greatly different from those of adult trilobites,<ref>M\u00fcller, K. J. & Walossek, D. (1987): \"Morphology, ontogeny, and life habit of ''Agnostus pisiformis'' from the Upper Cambrian of Sweden\". ''Fossils and Strata'', '''19''', 1-124.</ref> suggesting they are not members of the [[lamellipedia]]n [[clade]], of which trilobites are a part. Instead, the limbs of agnostids closely resemble those of stem group crustaceans, although they lack the [[proximal endite]], which defines that group. They are likely the [[sister taxon]] to the crustacean stem lineage, and, as such, part of the clade [[Crustaceomorpha]].<ref>Bergstr\u00f6m, J. & Hou, X.G. (2005). \"Early Palaeozoic non-lamellipedian arthropods\". In S. Koenemann & A. J. Ronald (eds.), ''Crustacea and Arthropod Relationships'' (Volume , pp. 75-93). Taylor and Francis Group.</ref> Other researchers have suggested, based on a [[cladistic]] analyses of [[dorsum (anatomy)|dorsal]] [[exoskeleton|exoskeletal]] features, that Eodiscina and Agnostida are closely united, and that the Eodiscina descended from the trilobite order [[Ptychopariida]].<ref>Cotton, T.

Taylor and Francis Group.</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nScientists have long debated whether the agnostids lived a [[pelagic]] or a [[benthic]] lifestyle. Their lack of eyes, a morphology not well-suited for swimming, and their fossils found in association with other benthic trilobites all suggest a benthic (bottom-dwelling) mode of life. They are likely to have lived on areas of the ocean floor that received little or no light and fed on [[detritus]] that descended from upper layers of the sea to the bottom. In contrast, their wide geographic dispersion in the [[fossil record]] is uncharacteristic of benthic animals, suggesting a pelagic existence. The thoracic segment appears to form a hinge between the head and pygidium allowing for a bivalved [[ostracod]]an-type lifestyle. Furthermore, the orientation of the thoracic appendages appears ill-suited for benthic living. However, recent work suggests that some agnostids were benthic predators, engaging in cannibalism and possibly manifesting pack-hunting behavior.<ref>McMenamin, M. A. S.

These techniques differ in the mechanism used to apply suction, in how early in pregnancy they can be used, and in whether cervical dilation is necessary.\n\nMVA, also known as \"mini-suction\" and \"[[menstrual extraction]]\", can be used in very early pregnancy, and does not require cervical dilation. [[Dilation and curettage]] (D&C), the second most common method of surgical abortion, is a standard gynecological procedure performed for a variety of reasons, including examination of the uterine lining for possible malignancy, investigation of abnormal bleeding, and abortion. [[Curettage]] refers to cleaning the walls of the [[uterus]] with a [[curette]]. The [[World Health Organization]] recommends this procedure, also called ''sharp curettage,'' only when MVA is unavailable.<ref>{{Cite book|author=[[World Health Organization]] |chapter=Dilatation and curettage |chapterurl=http://www.who.int/reproductive-health/impac/Procedures/Dilatetion_P61_P63.html |title=Managing Complications in Pregnancy and Childbirth: A Guide for Midwives and Doctors |publisher=[[World Health Organization]] |location=Geneva |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-92-4-154587-7 |oclc=181845530 |accessdate=5 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nFrom the 15th week of gestation until approximately the 26th, other techniques must be used. [[Dilation and evacuation]] (D&E) consists of opening the [[cervix]] of the uterus and emptying it using surgical instruments and suction.  After the 16th week of gestation, abortions can also be induced by [[intact dilation and extraction]] (IDX) (also called intrauterine cranial decompression), which requires surgical decompression of the fetus's head before evacuation. IDX is sometimes called \"[[partial-birth abortion]]\", which has been [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act|federally banned]] in the United States.\n\nIn the third trimester of pregnancy, induced abortion may be performed surgically by [[intact dilation and extraction]] or by hysterotomy. [[Hysterotomy abortion]] is a procedure similar to a [[caesarean section]] and is performed under [[general anesthesia]]. It requires a smaller incision than a caesarean section and is used during later stages of pregnancy.<ref name=\"encarta\">{{cite encyclopedia|last=McGee |first=Glenn |authorlink=Glenn McGee |author2=[[Jon F.

What is the effect of feticide on labor induction abortion outcome? Deliberately causing demise of the fetus before labor induction abortion is performed primarily to avoid transient fetal survival after expulsion; this approach may be for the comfort of both the woman and the staff, to avoid futile resuscitation efforts. Some providers allege that feticide also facilitates delivery, although little data support this claim. Transient fetal survival is very unlikely after intraamniotic installation of saline or urea, which are directly feticidal. Transient survival with misoprostol for labor induction abortion at greater than 18 weeks ranges from 0% to 50% and has been observed in up to 13% of abortions performed with high-dose oxytocin. Factors associated with a higher likelihood of transient fetal survival with labor induction abortion include increasing gestational age, decreasing abortion interval and the use of nonfeticidal inductive agents such as the PGE1 analogues.\"|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nOnly limited data are available comparing this method with dilation and extraction.<ref name=Labor_Induced_Abortion/>  Unlike D&E, labor induced abortions after 18 weeks may be complicated by the occurrence of brief fetal survival, which may be legally characterized as live birth.

These requirements usually depend on the age of the fetus, often using a [[Pregnancy#Terminology|trimester]]-based system to regulate the window of legality, or as in the U.S., on a doctor's evaluation of the fetus' [[Fetal viability|viability]].

The selective termination of a female fetus is most common.\n\nSex-selective abortion is partially responsible for the noticeable disparities between the birth rates of male and female children in some countries. The preference for male children is reported in many areas of Asia, and abortion used to limit female births has been reported in Taiwan, South Korea, India, and China.<ref>Banister, Judith.
